00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:48,599
in the community but for us that means
 

321
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,589
in the community but for us that means
releasing the training data releasing

322
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:50,599
releasing the training data releasing
 

323
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,550
releasing the training data releasing
the training code and then also having

324
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
the training code and then also having
 

325
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,309
the training code and then also having
open weights like this and we'll get

326
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:55,319
open weights like this and we'll get
 

327
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,150
open weights like this and we'll get
into the details of the models and again

328
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
into the details of the models and again
 

329
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,070
into the details of the models and again
and again as we try to get deep into how

330
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
and again as we try to get deep into how
 

331
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,150
and again as we try to get deep into how
the models will train were trained we

332
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
the models will train were trained we
 

333
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,070
the models will train were trained we
will say things like the data processing

334
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,080
will say things like the data processing
 

335
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,869
will say things like the data processing
data filtering data quality is the

336
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:06,879
data filtering data quality is the
 

337
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,070
data filtering data quality is the
number one determinant of the model

338
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,080
number one determinant of the model
 

339
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,790
number one determinant of the model
quality and then a lot of the training

340
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
quality and then a lot of the training
 

341
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,790
quality and then a lot of the training
code is the determinant on how long it

342
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
code is the determinant on how long it
 

343
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,990
code is the determinant on how long it
takes to train and how faster

344
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,000
takes to train and how faster
 

345
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,790
takes to train and how faster
experimentation is so without fully

346
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:17,800
experimentation is so without fully
 

347
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,110
experimentation is so without fully
open- Source models where you have

348
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
open- Source models where you have
 

349
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,629
open- Source models where you have
access to this data it is hard to know

350
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
access to this data it is hard to know
 

351
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,270
access to this data it is hard to know
or it's harder to replicate so we'll get

352
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,280
or it's harder to replicate so we'll get
 

353
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,670
or it's harder to replicate so we'll get
into cost numbers for deeps B3 on mostly

354
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
into cost numbers for deeps B3 on mostly
 

355
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,869
into cost numbers for deeps B3 on mostly
GPU hours and how much you could pay to

356
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:30,879
GPU hours and how much you could pay to
 

357
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,790
GPU hours and how much you could pay to
rent those yourselves but without the

358
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
rent those yourselves but without the
 

359
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,909
rent those yourselves but without the
data the replication cost is going to be

360
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:34,919
data the replication cost is going to be
 

361
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,150
data the replication cost is going to be
far far higher and same goes for the

362
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,160
far far higher and same goes for the
 

363
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,110
far far higher and same goes for the
code we should also say that this is

364
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,120
code we should also say that this is
 

365
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,390
code we should also say that this is
probably one of the more open models out

366
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
probably one of the more open models out
 

367
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,469
probably one of the more open models out
of the frontier models so like in this

368
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479
of the frontier models so like in this
 

369
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,749
of the frontier models so like in this
full spectrum where probably the fullest

370
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
full spectrum where probably the fullest
 

371
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,589
full spectrum where probably the fullest
open source like you said open code open

372
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:50,599
open source like you said open code open
 

373
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,830

data open weights this is not open code
 

375
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,950
data open weights this is not open code
this is probably not open data

376
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
this is probably not open data
 

377
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,510
this is probably not open data
and this is open weights and the

378
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
and this is open weights and the
 

379
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,710
and this is open weights and the
licensing is uh MIT license or it's uh I

380
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
licensing is uh MIT license or it's uh I
 

381
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,830
licensing is uh MIT license or it's uh I
mean there's some nuance and the

382
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
mean there's some nuance and the
 

383
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,670
mean there's some nuance and the
different models but it's towards the

384
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
different models but it's towards the
 

385
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,309
different models but it's towards the
free in terms of the open source

386
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:11,319
free in terms of the open source
 

387
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,909
free in terms of the open source
movement these are the kind of the good

388
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:12,919

uh and we'll talk about licenses more

404
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
uh and we'll talk about licenses more
 

405
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,670
uh and we'll talk about licenses more
the Deep seek R1 model has a very

406
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
the Deep seek R1 model has a very
 

407
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,829
the Deep seek R1 model has a very
permissive license it's called the M

permissive license it's called the M
 

409
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,790
permissive license it's called the M
license that effectively means there's

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:39,800
license that effectively means there's
 

411
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,790
license that effectively means there's
no Downstream restrictions on commercial

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,029
no Downstream restrictions on commercial
use there's no use case restrictions you

414
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:44,039
use there's no use case restrictions you
 

415
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,710
use there's no use case restrictions you
can use the outputs from the models to

416
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
can use the outputs from the models to
 

417
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,190
can use the outputs from the models to
create synthetic data and this is all

418
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
create synthetic data and this is all
 

419
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,470
create synthetic data and this is all
fantastic I think the closest pier is

420
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:51,480
fantastic I think the closest pier is
 

421
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,190
fantastic I think the closest pier is
something like llama where you have the

422
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
something like llama where you have the
 

423
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,710
something like llama where you have the
weights and you have a technical report

424
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,720
weights and you have a technical report
 

425
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,069
weights and you have a technical report
and the technical report is very good

426
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:58,079
and the technical report is very good
 

427
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,870
and the technical report is very good
for llama one of the most red p PDFs of

428
00:08:59,870 --> 00:08:59,880
for llama one of the most red p PDFs of
 

429
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,230
for llama one of the most red p PDFs of
the year last year is the Llama 3 paper

430
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
the year last year is the Llama 3 paper
 

431
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,829
the year last year is the Llama 3 paper
but in some ways it's slightly less

432
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
but in some ways it's slightly less
 

433
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,790
but in some ways it's slightly less
actionable it has less details on the

434
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:05,800
actionable it has less details on the
 

435
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,870
actionable it has less details on the
training specifics like less plots um

436
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
training specifics like less plots um
 

437
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,230
training specifics like less plots um
and so on and the Llama 3 license is

438
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
and so on and the Llama 3 license is
 

439
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,350
and so on and the Llama 3 license is
more restrictive than MIT and then

440
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
more restrictive than MIT and then
 

441
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,269
more restrictive than MIT and then
between the deep sea custom license and

442
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
between the deep sea custom license and
 

443
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,870
between the deep sea custom license and
the Llama license we could get into this

444
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
the Llama license we could get into this
 

445
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,350
the Llama license we could get into this
whole Rabbit Hole I think we we we'll

446
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
whole Rabbit Hole I think we we we'll
 

447
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,750
whole Rabbit Hole I think we we we'll
make sure we want to go down the license

448
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
make sure we want to go down the license
 

449
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,990
make sure we want to go down the license
rabbit hole before we do specifics yeah

450
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
rabbit hole before we do specifics yeah
 

451
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,750
rabbit hole before we do specifics yeah
and I mean so it should be stated that

452
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
and I mean so it should be stated that
 

453
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,470
and I mean so it should be stated that
one of the implications of deep secret

454
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
one of the implications of deep secret
 

455
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,910
one of the implications of deep secret
puts pressure on llama and everybody

456
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
puts pressure on llama and everybody
 

457
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,430
puts pressure on llama and everybody
else on open AI to push towards uh open

458
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
else on open AI to push towards uh open
 

459
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,990
else on open AI to push towards uh open
source and that's the other side of Open

460
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,000
source and that's the other side of Open
 

461
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,350
source and that's the other side of Open
Source that uh you mentioned is how much

462
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
Source that uh you mentioned is how much
 

463
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,790
Source that uh you mentioned is how much
is published in detail about it so how

464
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:37,800
is published in detail about it so how
 

465
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,870
is published in detail about it so how
open are you with the sort of the

466
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:39,880
open are you with the sort of the
 

467
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,750
open are you with the sort of the
insights behind the code so like how

468
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
insights behind the code so like how
 

469
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,910
insights behind the code so like how
good is the technical reports are they

470
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
good is the technical reports are they
 

471
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,509
good is the technical reports are they
hand wavy or is there actual uh details

472
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:48,519
hand wavy or is there actual uh details
 

473
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,630
hand wavy or is there actual uh details
in there and that's one of the things

474
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:49,640
in there and that's one of the things
 

475
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,190
in there and that's one of the things
that deep seek did well is they publish

476
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
that deep seek did well is they publish
 

477
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,350
that deep seek did well is they publish
a lot of the details yeah especially in

the other implication of open weights

510
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
the other implication of open weights
 

511
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,150
the other implication of open weights
just you know there's uh a topic we'll

512
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
just you know there's uh a topic we'll
 

513
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,350
just you know there's uh a topic we'll
return to often here

514
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
return to often here
 

515
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,150
return to often here
so there's a uh fear that China the

516
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
so there's a uh fear that China the
 

517
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,150
so there's a uh fear that China the
nation might have interest in um

518
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,160
nation might have interest in um
 

519
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,110
nation might have interest in um
stealing American data violating privacy

520
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,120
stealing American data violating privacy
 

521
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,310
stealing American data violating privacy
of American citizens what can we say

522
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
of American citizens what can we say
 

523
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,790
of American citizens what can we say
about open weights to help us understand

524
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:49,800
about open weights to help us understand
 

525
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,550
about open weights to help us understand
what what the weights are able to do

526
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
what what the weights are able to do
 

527
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,949
what what the weights are able to do
yeah in terms of stealing people's data

528
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
yeah in terms of stealing people's data
 

529
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,350
yeah in terms of stealing people's data
yeah so these weights that you can

530
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,360
yeah so these weights that you can
 

531
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,750
yeah so these weights that you can

00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,230
that is deeply connected to the soul of

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
Open Source so it's not the model that
 

571
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,269
Open Source so it's not the model that
steals your data it's clovers hosting

572
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:40,279
steals your data it's clovers hosting

steals your data it's clovers hosting
the model which could be China if you're

574
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
the model which could be China if you're
 

575
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,030
the model which could be China if you're
using the Deep seek app or it could be

576
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,040
using the Deep seek app or it could be
 

577
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,190
using the Deep seek app or it could be
perplexity uh you know you're trusting

578
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,200
perplexity uh you know you're trusting
 

579
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,269
perplexity uh you know you're trusting
them with your data or open AI you're

580
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:50,279
them with your data or open AI you're
 

581
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,790
them with your data or open AI you're
trusting them with your data and some of

582
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:51,800
trusting them with your data and some of
 

583
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,910
trusting them with your data and some of
these are American companies some of

584
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:52,920
these are American companies some of
 

585
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,150
these are American companies some of
these are Chinese companies but the

586
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
these are Chinese companies but the
 

587
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,150
these are Chinese companies but the
model itself is not doing the stealing

588
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,160
model itself is not doing the stealing
 

589
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,150
model itself is not doing the stealing
it's the host all right

590
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
it's the host all right
 

591
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,269
it's the host all right
so uh back to the basics what's the

592
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
so uh back to the basics what's the
 

593
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,949
so uh back to the basics what's the
difference between deep seek V3 and deep

594
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:05,959
difference between deep seek V3 and deep
 

595
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,750
difference between deep seek V3 and deep
seek R1 can we try to like lay out the

596
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
seek R1 can we try to like lay out the
 

597
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,910
seek R1 can we try to like lay out the
confusion potential yes so for one I

598
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:12,920
confusion potential yes so for one I
 

599
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,710
confusion potential yes so for one I
have very understanding of many people

600
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
have very understanding of many people
 

601
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,710
have very understanding of many people
being confused by these two model names

602
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
being confused by these two model names
 

603
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,590
being confused by these two model names
so I would say the best way to think

604
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:18,600
so I would say the best way to think
 

605
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,509
so I would say the best way to think
about this is that when training a

606
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:20,519
about this is that when training a
 

607
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,829
about this is that when training a
language model you have what is called

608
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
language model you have what is called
 

609
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,030
language model you have what is called
pre-training which is when you're

610
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
pre-training which is when you're

internet text you're trying to predict
 

615
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,509
internet text you're trying to predict
the next token and what to know about

616
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:30,519
the next token and what to know about
 

617
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,389
the next token and what to know about
these new deep seek models is that they

618
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
these new deep seek models is that they
 

619
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,870
these new deep seek models is that they
do this internet large scale

620
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
do this internet large scale
 

621
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,189
do this internet large scale

with than chat GPT and then what deep

630
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:46,839
with than chat GPT and then what deep
 

631
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,910
with than chat GPT and then what deep
seek did is they've done two different

632
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:48,920

is pre-training and what is posttraining
 

713

yeah so pre-training I'm using some of
the same words to really get the message

reinforcement learning with language

956
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
reinforcement learning with language
 

957
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,029
reinforcement learning with language
models and it has been taking off

958
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
models and it has been taking off
 

959
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,909
models and it has been taking off
especially in this deep seek moment and

960
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:00,919
especially in this deep seek moment and
 

961
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,029
especially in this deep seek moment and
we should say that there's a lot of

962
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,039
we should say that there's a lot of
 

963
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,990
we should say that there's a lot of
exciting stuff going on on the uh again

964
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,000
exciting stuff going on on the uh again
 

965
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,549
exciting stuff going on on the uh again
across the stack but the post training

966
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
across the stack but the post training
 

967
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,510
across the stack but the post training
probably this year there's going to be a

968
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,520
probably this year there's going to be a
 

969
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,669
probably this year there's going to be a
lot of interesting developments in the

970
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
lot of interesting developments in the
 

971
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,310
lot of interesting developments in the
post training we'll we'll talk about it

972
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
post training we'll we'll talk about it
 

973
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,990
post training we'll we'll talk about it
uh I almost forgot to talk about the the

974
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
uh I almost forgot to talk about the the
 

975
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,149
uh I almost forgot to talk about the the
difference between uh deep seek V3 and

976
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:16,159
difference between uh deep seek V3 and
 

977
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,549
difference between uh deep seek V3 and
R1 on the user experience side so forget

978
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:19,559
R1 on the user experience side so forget
 

979
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,950
R1 on the user experience side so forget
the technical stuff forget all that just

980
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:21,960
the technical stuff forget all that just
 

981
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,549
the technical stuff forget all that just
people that don't know anything about AI

982
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:23,559
people that don't know anything about AI
 

983
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,310
people that don't know anything about AI
they show up like what's the actual

984
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,320
they show up like what's the actual
 

985
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,230
they show up like what's the actual
experience what's the use case for each

986
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,240
experience what's the use case for each
 

987
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,190
experience what's the use case for each
one when they actually like type and

988
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
one when they actually like type and
 

989
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,070
one when they actually like type and
talk to it what what is he good at and

990
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,080
talk to it what what is he good at and
 

991
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,470
talk to it what what is he good at and
that kind of thing so let's start with

992
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
that kind of thing so let's start with
 

993
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,710
that kind of thing so let's start with
deep seek V3 again it's what more people

994
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
deep seek V3 again it's what more people
 

995
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,149

or not and there's a spectrum there well
I mean it's some of the we'll talk about

1268
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,120
I mean it's some of the we'll talk about
 

1269
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,110
I mean it's some of the we'll talk about
different benchmarks of s but some is

1270
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,120
different benchmarks of s but some is
 

1271
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,750
different benchmarks of s but some is
just a Vibe like that in itself is a

1272
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
just a Vibe like that in itself is a
 

1273
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,110
just a Vibe like that in itself is a
let's say quote fire tweet yeah if I

1274
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
let's say quote fire tweet yeah if I
 

1275
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,029
let's say quote fire tweet yeah if I
I'm trying to produce something

1276
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
I'm trying to produce something
 

1277
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,549
I'm trying to produce something
something where people are like oh

1278
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:03,559
something where people are like oh
 

1279
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,430
something where people are like oh
okay so that's CH thought we'll probably

1280
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
okay so that's CH thought we'll probably
 

1281
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,909
okay so that's CH thought we'll probably
return to it

1282
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:06,919
return to it
 

1283
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,669
return to it
more how are they able to achieve such

1284
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:10,679
more how are they able to achieve such
 

1285
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,830
more how are they able to achieve such
low cost on the training and the

1286
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:12,840
low cost on the training and the
 

1287
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,190
low cost on the training and the
inference maybe you could talk the

1288
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,200
inference maybe you could talk the
 

1289
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,669
inference maybe you could talk the
training first yeah so there's there's

1290
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:16,679
training first yeah so there's there's
 

1291
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,669
training first yeah so there's there's
two main techniques that they

1292
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:18,679
two main techniques that they
 

1293
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,310
two main techniques that they
implemented that are probably the

1294
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,320
implemented that are probably the
 

1295
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,230
implemented that are probably the
majority of their efficiency and then

1296
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,240
majority of their efficiency and then
 

1297
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,149
majority of their efficiency and then
there's a lot of implementation details

1298
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:25,159
there's a lot of implementation details
 

1299
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,029
there's a lot of implementation details
that maybe we'll gloss over or get into

1300
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
that maybe we'll gloss over or get into
 

1301
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,870
that maybe we'll gloss over or get into
later that sort of contribut to it but

1302
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
later that sort of contribut to it but
 

1303
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,630
later that sort of contribut to it but
those two main things are one is they

1304
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:31,640
those two main things are one is they
 

1305
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,430
those two main things are one is they
went to a mixture of experts model uh

1306
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:34,440
went to a mixture of experts model uh
 

1307
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,789
went to a mixture of experts model uh
which which we'll Define in a second and

1308
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:35,799
which which we'll Define in a second and
 

1309
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,029
which which we'll Define in a second and
then the other thing is that they

1310
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
then the other thing is that they
 

1311
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,630
then the other thing is that they
invented this new technique called MLA

1312
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:39,640
invented this new technique called MLA
 

1313
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,470
invented this new technique called MLA

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,269
portions of the model activate right
you'll have a set number of experts in

1368
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:38,279
you'll have a set number of experts in
 

1369
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,630
you'll have a set number of experts in
the model and a set number that are

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,230
the model and a set number that are
activated each time and this

1372
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,240
activated each time and this
 

1373
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,990
activated each time and this
dramatically reduces both your training

1374
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,000
dramatically reduces both your training
 

1375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,870
dramatically reduces both your training
and inference cost because now you're

1376
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:45,880
and inference cost because now you're
 

1377
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,310
and inference cost because now you're
you know if you think about the

1378
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,320
you know if you think about the
 

1379
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,190
you know if you think about the
parameter count as the sort of total

1380
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
parameter count as the sort of total
 

1381
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,630
parameter count as the sort of total
embedding space for all of this

1382
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
embedding space for all of this
 

1383
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,430
embedding space for all of this
knowledge that you're compressing down

1384
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,440
knowledge that you're compressing down
 

1385
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,389

during
 

1387
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,110
during
training when you're embedding this data

1388
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,120
training when you're embedding this data
 

1389
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,389
training when you're embedding this data
in instead of having to activate every

1390
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:58,399
in instead of having to activate every
 

1391
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,750
in instead of having to activate every
single parameter every single time

1392
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
single parameter every single time
 

1393
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,510
single parameter every single time
you're training or running inference now

1394
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
you're training or running inference now
 

1395
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,909
you're training or running inference now
you can just activate a subset and the

1396
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
you can just activate a subset and the
 

1397
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,950
you can just activate a subset and the
model will learn which expert to route

1398
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:05,960
model will learn which expert to route
 

1399
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,269
model will learn which expert to route
to for different tasks and so this is a

1400
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:08,279
to for different tasks and so this is a
 

1401
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,149
to for different tasks and so this is a
humongous innovation in terms of hey I

1402
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:11,159
humongous innovation in terms of hey I
 

1403
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,990
humongous innovation in terms of hey I
can continue to grow the total embedding

1404
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,000
can continue to grow the total embedding
 

1405
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,990
can continue to grow the total embedding
space of parameters and so deep seeks

1406
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,000
space of parameters and so deep seeks
 

1407
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,789
space of parameters and so deep seeks
model is you know 600 something billion

1408
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
model is you know 600 something billion
 

1409
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,110
model is you know 600 something billion
parameters right uh relative to llama

1410
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
parameters right uh relative to llama
 

1411
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,310
parameters right uh relative to llama
405b it's 405 billion parameters right

1412
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,320
405b it's 405 billion parameters right
 

1413
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,510
405b it's 405 billion parameters right
llama relative to llama 70b it's 70

1414
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
llama relative to llama 70b it's 70
 

1415
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,990
llama relative to llama 70b it's 70
billion parameters right so this model

1416
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,000
billion parameters right so this model
 

1417
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,950
billion parameters right so this model
technically has more embedding space for

1418
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
technically has more embedding space for
 

1419
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,110
technically has more embedding space for
information right to compress all of the

1423
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,510
world's knowledge that's on the internet
down but at the same time it is only

1424
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,520
down but at the same time it is only
 

1425
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,830
down but at the same time it is only
activating around 37 billion of the

1426
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
activating around 37 billion of the
 

1427
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,230
activating around 37 billion of the
parameters so only 37 billion of these

1428
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
parameters so only 37 billion of these
 

1429
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,110
parameters so only 37 billion of these
parameters actually need to be computed

1430
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,120
parameters actually need to be computed
 

1431
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,149

every single time you're training data

1432
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
every single time you're training data
 

1433
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,710
every single time you're training data
or inferencing data out of it and so

1434
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
or inferencing data out of it and so
 

1435
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,789
or inferencing data out of it and so
versus versus again the Llama model 70

1436
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
versus versus again the Llama model 70
 

1437
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,350
versus versus again the Llama model 70
billion parameters must be activated or

405 billion parameters must be activated
 

1441
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,830
405 billion parameters must be activated
so you've dramatically reduced your

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
so you've dramatically reduced your
 

1443
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,470
so you've dramatically reduced your

1475
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,389

00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:55,880
Revolution networks gotten larger and
 

1501
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,470
Revolution networks gotten larger and
larger and at a certain point the

larger and at a certain point the
 

1503
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,750
larger and at a certain point the
scaling laws appeared where people

1504
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
scaling laws appeared where people
 

1505
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,710

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:01,720
realized this is a scaling law Shirt By
 

1507
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,669
realized this is a scaling law Shirt By
the way representing scaling laws where

00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
the way representing scaling laws where
 

1509
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,029
the way representing scaling laws where
it became more and more formalized that

00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:08,039
it became more and more formalized that

dimensions of what bigger means so uh

1514
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
dimensions of what bigger means so uh
 

1515
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,669
dimensions of what bigger means so uh
and but these are all sort of neural

1516
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:14,679
and but these are all sort of neural
 

1517
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,669
and but these are all sort of neural
networks we're talking about and we're

1518
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:16,679
networks we're talking about and we're
 

1519
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,149
networks we're talking about and we're
talking about different architectures of

1520
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
talking about different architectures of
 

1521
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,149
talking about different architectures of
how construct to construct these neural

1522
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
how construct to construct these neural
 

1523
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,789
how construct to construct these neural

yeah every different type of model has a

1528
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
yeah every different type of model has a
 

1529
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,149
yeah every different type of model has a
different scaling LW for it which which

1530
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
different scaling LW for it which which
 

1531
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,230
different scaling LW for it which which
is effectively for how much compute you

1532
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
is effectively for how much compute you
 

1533
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,710
is effectively for how much compute you
put in the architecture will get to

1535
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,470
put in the architecture will get to
different levels of performance at test

1541
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,389

consider the inference benefits which

1542
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:41,399
consider the inference benefits which
 

1543
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,549
consider the inference benefits which
are also big at training time your

1544
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:43,559
are also big at training time your
 

1545
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,110
are also big at training time your
efficiency with your gpus is

1546
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
efficiency with your gpus is
 

1547
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,750
efficiency with your gpus is
dramatically improved by using this

1548
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:46,760
dramatically improved by using this

1551
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,590

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
so you can get effectively the same
 

1553
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,509
so you can get effectively the same

because it's a implementation complexity

interconnects are limited to some extent
 

1739
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:05,870
interconnects are limited to some extent
um by the restrictions of the gpus that

1740
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:05,880
um by the restrictions of the gpus that
 

1741

um by the restrictions of the gpus that
were shipped into China legally not the

this model they had to figure out how to

1748
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:13,799
this model they had to figure out how to
 

1749
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,830
this model they had to figure out how to
get efficiencies right and one of those

1750
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
get efficiencies right and one of those
 

1751
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,029
get efficiencies right and one of those
things is that instead of just calling

1752
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:18,039
things is that instead of just calling
 

1753
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,710
things is that instead of just calling
the Nvidia Library nickel right they

1754
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:20,720
the Nvidia Library nickel right they
 

1755
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,789
the Nvidia Library nickel right they
instead created their they scheduled

1756
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
instead created their they scheduled
 

1757
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,190
instead created their they scheduled
their own Communications uh which which

1758
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
their own Communications uh which which
 

1759
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,950
their own Communications uh which which
the lab some of the labs do right um em

1760
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:27,960
the lab some of the labs do right um em
 

1761
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,310
the lab some of the labs do right um em
meta talked about in llama 3 how they

1762
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:29,320
meta talked about in llama 3 how they
 

1763
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,149
meta talked about in llama 3 how they
made their own custom version of nickel

1764
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:31,159
made their own custom version of nickel
 

1765
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,230
made their own custom version of nickel
this is they didn't they didn't talk

1766
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
this is they didn't they didn't talk
 

1767
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,950
this is they didn't they didn't talk
about the implementation details this is

1768
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:33,960
about the implementation details this is
 

1769
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,870
about the implementation details this is
some of what they did probably not as

1770
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:35,880
some of what they did probably not as
 

1771
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,710
some of what they did probably not as
well as maybe not as well as deep seek

1772
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:37,720
well as maybe not as well as deep seek
 

1773
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,430
well as maybe not as well as deep seek
Because deep seek you know necessity is

1774
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
Because deep seek you know necessity is
 

1775
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,669
Because deep seek you know necessity is
the mother of innovation and they had to

1776
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
the mother of innovation and they had to
 

1777
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,430
the mother of innovation and they had to
do this whereas uh in the casa you know

1778
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:44,440
do this whereas uh in the casa you know
 

1779
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,389
do this whereas uh in the casa you know
open AI has people that do this sort of

1780
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
open AI has people that do this sort of
 

1781
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,190
open AI has people that do this sort of
stuff anthropic Etc uh but you know deep

1782
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
stuff anthropic Etc uh but you know deep
 

1783
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,549
stuff anthropic Etc uh but you know deep
seek certainly did it publicly and they

1784
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
seek certainly did it publicly and they
 

1785
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,230
seek certainly did it publicly and they
may have done it even better because

1786
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
may have done it even better because
 

1787
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,149
may have done it even better because
they were gimped on a certain aspect of

1788
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:54,159
they were gimped on a certain aspect of
 

1789
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,509
they were gimped on a certain aspect of
the chips that they have access to and

1790
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:56,519
the chips that they have access to and
 

1791
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,230
the chips that they have access to and
so they

1792
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
so they
 

1793
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,230
so they
scheduled

1794
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,240
scheduled
 

1795
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,750
scheduled
Communications um you know by scheduling

1796
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,760
Communications um you know by scheduling
 

1797
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,750
Communications um you know by scheduling
specific SMS SMS you could think of as

1798
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
specific SMS SMS you could think of as
 

1799
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,549
specific SMS SMS you could think of as
like the core on a GPU right so there's

1800
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:06,559
like the core on a GPU right so there's
 

1801
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,030
like the core on a GPU right so there's
hundreds of cores or there's you know a

1802
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
hundreds of cores or there's you know a
 

1803
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,510
hundreds of cores or there's you know a
bit over a 100 cores SMS on a GPU and

1804
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
bit over a 100 cores SMS on a GPU and
 

1805
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,310
bit over a 100 cores SMS on a GPU and
they were specifically scheduling hey

1806
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,320
they were specifically scheduling hey
 

1807
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,589
they were specifically scheduling hey
which ones are running the model which

1808
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:14,599
which ones are running the model which
 

1809
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,149
which ones are running the model which
ones are doing all reduce which one are

1810
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
ones are doing all reduce which one are
 

1811
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,710
ones are doing all reduce which one are
doing all gather right and they would

1812
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:17,720
doing all gather right and they would
 

1813
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,149
doing all gather right and they would
flip back and forth between them and

1814
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:19,159
flip back and forth between them and
 

1815
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,270
flip back and forth between them and
this requires extremely low-level

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,990
this requires extremely low-level
programming this is what nickel does

1818
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,000
programming this is what nickel does
 

1819
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,109
programming this is what nickel does
automatically or other Nvidia libraries

1820
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
automatically or other Nvidia libraries
 

1821
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,829
automatically or other Nvidia libraries
handle this automatically usually yeah

1822
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:26,839
handle this automatically usually yeah
 

1823
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,869
handle this automatically usually yeah
exactly and so so technically they're

1824
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
exactly and so so technically they're
 

1825
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,909
exactly and so so technically they're
using you know PTX which is like sort of

1826
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:30,919
using you know PTX which is like sort of
 

1827
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,550
using you know PTX which is like sort of
like you could think of it as like an

1828
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,560
like you could think of it as like an
 

1829
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,589
like you could think of it as like an
assembly type language it's not exactly

1830
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:34,599
assembly type language it's not exactly
 

1831
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,389
assembly type language it's not exactly
that or instruction set right like

1832
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:36,399
that or instruction set right like
 

1833
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,470
that or instruction set right like
coding directly to assembly or

1834
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:37,480
coding directly to assembly or
 

1835
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,430
coding directly to assembly or
instruction set it's not exactly that

1836
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,440
instruction set it's not exactly that
 

1837
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,629
instruction set it's not exactly that
but uh that's still part of technically

1838
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:41,639
but uh that's still part of technically
 

1839
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,669
but uh that's still part of technically
Cuda but it's like do I want to write in

1840
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
Cuda but it's like do I want to write in
 

1841
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,710
Cuda but it's like do I want to write in
Python you know pytorch equivalent and

1842
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:45,720
Python you know pytorch equivalent and
 

1843
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,430
Python you know pytorch equivalent and
call Nvidia libraries do I want to go

1844
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
call Nvidia libraries do I want to go
 

1845
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,550
call Nvidia libraries do I want to go
down to the ca level right or uh you

1846
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:49,560
down to the ca level right or uh you
 

1847
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,829
down to the ca level right or uh you
know and code even lower level or do I

1848
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:50,839
know and code even lower level or do I
 

1849
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,030
know and code even lower level or do I
want to go all the way down to the

1850
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,040
want to go all the way down to the
 

1851
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,030
want to go all the way down to the
assembly or Isa level and and there are

1852
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,040
assembly or Isa level and and there are
 

1853
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,389
assembly or Isa level and and there are
cases where you go all the way down

1854
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:55,399
cases where you go all the way down
 

1855
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,870
cases where you go all the way down
there at the very big Labs but most

1856
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:57,880
there at the very big Labs but most
 

1857
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,630
there at the very big Labs but most
companies just do not do that right

1858
00:34:59,630 --> 00:34:59,640
companies just do not do that right
 

1859
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,310
companies just do not do that right
because it's a waste of time and the

1860
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,320
because it's a waste of time and the
 

1861
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,349
because it's a waste of time and the
efficiency gains you get are not worth

1862
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
efficiency gains you get are not worth
 

1863
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,870
efficiency gains you get are not worth
it but deep seeks implementation is so

1864
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:05,880
it but deep seeks implementation is so
 

1865
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,589
it but deep seeks implementation is so
complex right especially with their

1866
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599
complex right especially with their
 

1867
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,670
complex right especially with their
mixture of experts right um people have

1868
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
mixture of experts right um people have
 

1869
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,069
mixture of experts right um people have
done mixture of experts but they're

1870
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:11,079
done mixture of experts but they're
 

1871
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,710
done mixture of experts but they're
generally 8 16 experts right and they

1872
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:13,720
generally 8 16 experts right and they
 

1873
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,589
generally 8 16 experts right and they
activate to so you know one of the words

1874
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
activate to so you know one of the words
 

1875
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,109
activate to so you know one of the words
we like Ed like to use is like sparsity

1876
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:18,119
we like Ed like to use is like sparsity
 

1877
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,030
we like Ed like to use is like sparsity
Factor right or usage right so so you

1878
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,040
Factor right or usage right so so you
 

1879
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,030
Factor right or usage right so so you
might have four you know one fourth of

1880
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,040
might have four you know one fourth of
 

1881
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,510
might have four you know one fourth of
your model activate right and and and

1882
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:24,520
your model activate right and and and
 

1883
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,950
your model activate right and and and
that's what Mist draws uh mixol model

1884
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
that's what Mist draws uh mixol model
 

1885
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,710
that's what Mist draws uh mixol model
right uh their model that really

1886
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720
right uh their model that really
 

1887
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,310
right uh their model that really
catapulted them to like oh my God

1888
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
catapulted them to like oh my God
 

1889
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,790
catapulted them to like oh my God
they're really really good um openi has

1890
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
they're really really good um openi has
 

1891
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,150
they're really really good um openi has

away from the auxiliary loss some of
 

2005
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,990
away from the auxiliary loss some of

them might already use it but you just
 

2007
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,550

the same thing and some of them are
 

2025
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,190
the same thing and some of them are
shared or a lot we have to take them on

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,829
like mix draw and othere models that
have been publicly released so this

2044

have been publicly released so this
 

2045
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:16,630

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,160
Nathan was getting at there was when you
 

2049
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,790
Nathan was getting at there was when you
have such a different level of sparsity

2050
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:21,800
have such a different level of sparsity
 

2051
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,470
have such a different level of sparsity
um you can't just have every GPU have

2052
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
um you can't just have every GPU have
 

2053
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,030
um you can't just have every GPU have
the entire model right the model's too

2054
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,040
the entire model right the model's too
 

2055
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,790
the entire model right the model's too
big there's too much complexity there so

2056
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:27,800
big there's too much complexity there so
 

2057
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,630
big there's too much complexity there so
you have to split up the model um with

2058
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:29,640
you have to split up the model um with
 

2059
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,470
you have to split up the model um with
different types of parallelism right and

2060
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:31,480
different types of parallelism right and
 

2061
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,030
different types of parallelism right and
so you might have different experts on

2062
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
so you might have different experts on
 

2063
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,349
so you might have different experts on
different GPU nodes but now what what

2064
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
different GPU nodes but now what what
 

2065
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,430
different GPU nodes but now what what
happens when a to you know this set of

2066
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,440
happens when a to you know this set of
 

2067
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,349
happens when a to you know this set of
data that you get hey all of it looks

2068
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
data that you get hey all of it looks
 

2069
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,870
data that you get hey all of it looks
like this one way and all of it should

2070
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:40,880
like this one way and all of it should
 

2071
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,870
like this one way and all of it should
route to one part of my you know model

2072
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
route to one part of my you know model
 

2073
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,670
route to one part of my you know model
right um so so when all of it rout

2074
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:45,680
right um so so when all of it rout
 

2075
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,829
right um so so when all of it rout
routes to one part of the model then you

2076
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:47,839
routes to one part of the model then you
 

2077
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,390
routes to one part of the model then you
can have the you can have this

2078
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
can have the you can have this
 

2079
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,390
can have the you can have this

2081
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,230

2087
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,710
Network sits idle because all of the
tokens are just routing to that so this

2088
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720

2089
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,150

00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:50,839
Systems to work efficiently and for
 

2181
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,990
Systems to work efficiently and for
these bigger problems in the long term

2182
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,000
these bigger problems in the long term
 

2183
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,430
these bigger problems in the long term
might be more likely to scale and

2184
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
might be more likely to scale and
 

2185
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,430
might be more likely to scale and
continue to drive success

2186
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:58,440
continue to drive success
 

2187
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,190
continue to drive success
and therefore we were talking about

2188
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,200
and therefore we were talking about
 

2189
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,430
and therefore we were talking about
relatively small implementation changes

2190
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:02,440
relatively small implementation changes
 

2191
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,309
relatively small implementation changes
to the mixture of experts model and

2192
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:05,319
to the mixture of experts model and
 

2193
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:07,309
to the mixture of experts model and
therefore it's like okay like we will

2194
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:07,319
therefore it's like okay like we will
 

2195
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,630
therefore it's like okay like we will
need a few more years to know if one of

2196
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:09,640
need a few more years to know if one of
 

2197
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,990
need a few more years to know if one of
these were actually really crucial to

00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,000
these were actually really crucial to
 

2199
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,109
these were actually really crucial to
the bitter lesson but the bitter lesson

2200
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
the bitter lesson but the bitter lesson
 

2201
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,670
the bitter lesson but the bitter lesson
is really this long-term Arc of how

2202
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
is really this long-term Arc of how
 

2203

can pull up microwave gang essentially

2360
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:07,599
can pull up microwave gang essentially

it's a subreddit where everybody makes

2362
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
it's a subreddit where everybody makes
 

2363
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,309
it's a subreddit where everybody makes
posts that are just the letter M so it's

2364
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:11,319
posts that are just the letter M so it's
 

2365
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:14,309
posts that are just the letter M so it's
like so there's extremely long sequences

2366
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
like so there's extremely long sequences
 

2367
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,990
like so there's extremely long sequences
of the letter M and then the comments

2368
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,000
of the letter M and then the comments
 

2369
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,069
of the letter M and then the comments
are like beep beep because that's when

2370
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:17,079
are like beep beep because that's when
 

2371
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,750
are like beep beep because that's when
the microwave ends but if you pass this

you don't predict M's for a long time so

2380
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
you don't predict M's for a long time so
 

2381
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,990
you don't predict M's for a long time so

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,430
like you just stop the run restart from
the old version and then like change the

the old version and then like change the
 

2431
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,109
the old version and then like change the
data mix and then it keeps going there

Fast spikes and slow spikes where there

2438
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,160
Fast spikes and slow spikes where there
 

2439
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,630
Fast spikes and slow spikes where there
are sometimes where you're looking at

2440
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:24,640
are sometimes where you're looking at
 

2441
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,990
are sometimes where you're looking at
the loss and there other parameters you

2442
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,000
the loss and there other parameters you
 

2443
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,109
the loss and there other parameters you
can see it start to creep up and then

2444
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:28,119
can see it start to creep up and then
 

2445
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,510
can see it start to creep up and then
blow up and that's really hard to

2446
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
blow up and that's really hard to
 

2447
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,950
blow up and that's really hard to
recover from so you have to go back much

2448
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
recover from so you have to go back much
 

2449
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,549
recover from so you have to go back much
further so you have the stressful period

2450
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:32,559
further so you have the stressful period
 

2451
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:33,990
further so you have the stressful period
where it's like flat or might start

2452
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
where it's like flat or might start
 

2453
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,390
where it's like flat or might start
going up and you're like what do I do

2454
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:35,400
going up and you're like what do I do
 

2455
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,990
going up and you're like what do I do
whereas there also law spikes that are

whereas there also law spikes that are
it looks good and then there's one spiky

2458
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:38,680
it looks good and then there's one spiky
 

2459
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,190
it looks good and then there's one spiky
data point and what you can do is you

2460
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:40,200
data point and what you can do is you
 

2461
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,109
data point and what you can do is you
just skip those you you see that there's

2462
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:42,119
just skip those you you see that there's
 

2463
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,710
just skip those you you see that there's
a spike you're like okay I can ignore

2464
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:43,720
a spike you're like okay I can ignore
 

2465
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,309
a spike you're like okay I can ignore
this data don't update the model and do

2466
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:45,319
this data don't update the model and do
 

2467
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:47,230
this data don't update the model and do
the next one and it'll recover quickly

2468
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:47,240
the next one and it'll recover quickly
 

2469
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,710
the next one and it'll recover quickly
but these like un trickier

2470
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:49,720
but these like un trickier
 

2471
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,390
but these like un trickier
implementations so as you get more

2472
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:51,400
implementations so as you get more
 

2473
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,589
implementations so as you get more
complex in your architecture and you

2474
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
complex in your architecture and you
 

2475
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,190
complex in your architecture and you
scale up to more gpus you have more

2476
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:56,200
scale up to more gpus you have more
 

2477
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,190
scale up to more gpus you have more
potential for your loss blowing up so

2478
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:58,200
potential for your loss blowing up so
 

2479
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,910
potential for your loss blowing up so
it's like there there's and there's a

2480
00:45:59,910 --> 00:45:59,920
it's like there there's and there's a
 

2481
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,349
it's like there there's and there's a
distribution the whole idea of grocking

2482
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359
distribution the whole idea of grocking
 

2483
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,910
distribution the whole idea of grocking
also comes in right it's like just

2484
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:02,920
also comes in right it's like just
 

2485
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,430
also comes in right it's like just
because it slowed down from improving

2486
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:04,440
because it slowed down from improving
 

2487
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,190
because it slowed down from improving
and loss doesn't mean it's not learning

2488
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:06,200
and loss doesn't mean it's not learning
 

2489
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,630
and loss doesn't mean it's not learning
because all of a sudden it could be like

2490
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:07,640
because all of a sudden it could be like
 

2491
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,870
because all of a sudden it could be like
this and it could just Spike down and

2492
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880
this and it could just Spike down and
 

2493
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,710
this and it could just Spike down and
loss again because it learned truly

2494
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:10,720
loss again because it learned truly
 

2495
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,790
loss again because it learned truly
learned something right uh and it took

2496
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:12,800
learned something right uh and it took
 

2497
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,670
learned something right uh and it took
some time for it to learn that it's not

2498
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:14,680
some time for it to learn that it's not
 

2499
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,390
some time for it to learn that it's not
like a gradual process right and that's

2500
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
like a gradual process right and that's
 

2501
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,510
like a gradual process right and that's
that's what humans are like that's what

2502
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,520
that's what humans are like that's what
 

2503
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,349
that's what humans are like that's what
models are like so it's it's really a

2504
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
models are like so it's it's really a
 

2505
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,349
models are like so it's it's really a
stressful task as you mentioned and the

2506
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
stressful task as you mentioned and the
 

2507
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,549
stressful task as you mentioned and the
whole time the the the dollar count is

2508
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:23,559
whole time the the the dollar count is
 

2509
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,190
whole time the the the dollar count is

00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:02,880
post training because the GPU cost for
 

2665
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,190
post training because the GPU cost for
training is lower so you can make a

2666
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,200
training is lower so you can make a
 

2667
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,670
training is lower so you can make a
higher percentage of your training runs

2668
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,680
higher percentage of your training runs
 

2669
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,069
higher percentage of your training runs
Yol will runs yeah for for now yeah for

00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:17,559
right in many cases yeah I mean it looks
 

2677
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,549
right in many cases yeah I mean it looks
lucky right when you're but the hill to

00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,789
lucky right when you're but the hill to
climb if you're on one of these labs and

2680
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:21,799
climb if you're on one of these labs and
 

2681
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:23,030
climb if you're on one of these labs and
you have an evaluation you're not

00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,000
how you improve things there are
 

2687
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,349
how you improve things there are
localized improvements which might be

2688
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:28,359
localized improvements which might be
 

2689
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,030
localized improvements which might be
data improvements and these add up into

2690
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:30,040
data improvements and these add up into
 

2691
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,910
data improvements and these add up into
the whole model just being much better

2692
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:31,920
the whole model just being much better
 

2693
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,710
the whole model just being much better
and when you zoom in really close it can

2694
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:33,720
and when you zoom in really close it can
 

2695
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,789
and when you zoom in really close it can
be really obvious that this model is

2696
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:35,799
be really obvious that this model is
 

2697
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:37,549
be really obvious that this model is
just really bad at this thing and we can

2698
00:49:37,549 --> 00:49:37,559
just really bad at this thing and we can
 

2699
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,069
just really bad at this thing and we can
fix it and you just add these up so like

2700
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
fix it and you just add these up so like
 

2701
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,950
fix it and you just add these up so like
some of it feels like look but on the

this wasn't all for training you know

2886
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:53,559
this wasn't all for training you know
 

2887
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:55,150
this wasn't all for training you know
large language models this was mostly

2888
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:55,160
large language models this was mostly
 

2889
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,190
large language models this was mostly
for training models for their

quantitative trading as well as you know
 

2895
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,430
quantitative trading as well as you know
a lot of that was natural language

2896
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
a lot of that was natural language
 

2897
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,549
a lot of that was natural language
processing to be clear right um and so

2898
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:03,559
processing to be clear right um and so
 

2899
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:05,190
processing to be clear right um and so
this is the sort of History right so

2900
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
this is the sort of History right so
 

2901
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,190
this is the sort of History right so
verifiable fact is that in 2021 they

2902
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200
verifiable fact is that in 2021 they
 

2903
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,870
verifiable fact is that in 2021 they
built the largest chin uh cluster at

2904
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
built the largest chin uh cluster at
 

2905
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,190
built the largest chin uh cluster at
least they claim it was the largest

2906
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,200
least they claim it was the largest
 

2907
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,589
least they claim it was the largest
cluster in China 10,000 gpus before

2908
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:12,599
cluster in China 10,000 gpus before
 

2909
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,270
cluster in China 10,000 gpus before
export controls started yeah it's like

2910
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,280
export controls started yeah it's like
 

2911
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,990
export controls started yeah it's like
they've had a huge cluster before any

2912
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:17,000
they've had a huge cluster before any
 

2913
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,670
they've had a huge cluster before any
conversation of export controls so then

2914
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:18,680
conversation of export controls so then
 

2915
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,510
conversation of export controls so then
you step it forward to like what have

2916
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,520
you step it forward to like what have
 

2917
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,270
you step it forward to like what have
they done over the last four years since

2918
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:22,280
they done over the last four years since
 

2919
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,789
they done over the last four years since
then right um obviously they've

2920
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:23,799
then right um obviously they've
 

2921
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:25,549
then right um obviously they've
continued to operate the hedge fund

2922
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:25,559
continued to operate the hedge fund
 

2923
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:26,910
continued to operate the hedge fund
probably make tons of money and the

probably make tons of money and the
 

2925
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,630
probably make tons of money and the
other thing is that they've leaned more

2926
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:28,640
other thing is that they've leaned more
 

2927
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,990
other thing is that they've leaned more

is his way of doing this some of the
translated interviews with him are so he

2972
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:23,319
translated interviews with him are so he
 

2973
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:25,109
translated interviews with him are so he
has done interviews yeah you think he

2974
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
has done interviews yeah you think he
 

2975
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,270
has done interviews yeah you think he
would do a western interview or no or is

2976
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,280
would do a western interview or no or is
 

2977
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,030
would do a western interview or no or is
there controls on there hasn't been one

that was previously allowed in China but
 

3043
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,589
that was previously allowed in China but

for China right um and there's some
 

3049
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:54,870

know scheduling stuff right so so going

3058
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:03,280
know scheduling stuff right so so going
 

3059
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,349
know scheduling stuff right so so going
back to that right let's like this is

3060
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:05,359
back to that right let's like this is
 

3061
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,349
back to that right let's like this is
obviously not true in terms of their

3065
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,349

but for this training run you think

3066
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:12,359
but for this training run you think
 

3067
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,589
but for this training run you think
2,000 is the correct number or no so

3068
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:14,599
2,000 is the correct number or no so
 

3069
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:16,510
2,000 is the correct number or no so
this is where it takes um you know

3070
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:16,520
this is where it takes um you know
 

3071
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,710
this is where it takes um you know

zoning in right like what do you call

3074
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
zoning in right like what do you call
 

3075
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,390
zoning in right like what do you call
your training run right do you count all

3076
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
your training run right do you count all
 

3077
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,470
your training run right do you count all
of the research and ablations that you

3078
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
of the research and ablations that you
 

3079
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,870
of the research and ablations that you
ran right picking all the stuff because

3080
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:26,880
ran right picking all the stuff because
 

3081
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,589
ran right picking all the stuff because
yes you can do a YOLO run but at some

3082
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:28,599
yes you can do a YOLO run but at some
 

3083
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:29,870
yes you can do a YOLO run but at some
level you have to do the test at the

3084
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:29,880
level you have to do the test at the
 

3085
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,430
level you have to do the test at the
small scale and then you have to do some

3086
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
small scale and then you have to do some
 

3087
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,950
small scale and then you have to do some
test at medium scale before you go to a

3088
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
test at medium scale before you go to a
 

3089
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,150
test at medium scale before you go to a
large scale accepted practice is that

3090
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,160
large scale accepted practice is that
 

3091
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,710
large scale accepted practice is that
for any given model that is a notable

only the pre-training for V3 they did

3124
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:12,440
only the pre-training for V3 they did
 

3125
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,710
only the pre-training for V3 they did
not discuss cost on R1 they did not

3126
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:14,720
not discuss cost on R1 they did not
 

3127
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,510
not discuss cost on R1 they did not
discuss cost on all the other RL right

3128
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
discuss cost on all the other RL right
 

3129
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,670
discuss cost on all the other RL right
for the instruct model that they made

3130
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
for the instruct model that they made
 

3131
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,789
for the instruct model that they made
right they only discussed the

3132
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:20,799
right they only discussed the
 

3133
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,710
right they only discussed the
pre-training for the base model and they

3134
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:22,720
pre-training for the base model and they
 

3135
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,430
pre-training for the base model and they
did not discuss anything on research and

3136
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:24,440
did not discuss anything on research and
 

3137
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,309
did not discuss anything on research and
ablations and they do not talk about any

3138
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:26,319
ablations and they do not talk about any
 

3139
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,670
ablations and they do not talk about any
of the resources that are shared in

3140
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:27,680
of the resources that are shared in
 

3141
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,069
of the resources that are shared in
terms of hey the fund is using all these

3142
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
terms of hey the fund is using all these
 

3143
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,190
terms of hey the fund is using all these
gpus right and and we know that they're

3144
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:32,200
gpus right and and we know that they're
 

3145
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,870
gpus right and and we know that they're
very profitable and that 10,000 gpus in

3146
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:34,880
very profitable and that 10,000 gpus in
 

3147
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,789
very profitable and that 10,000 gpus in
in in 2021 so so the uh some some of the

3148
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:38,799
in in 2021 so so the uh some some of the
 

3149
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,510
in in 2021 so so the uh some some of the
research that we've found is that we

3150
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:40,520
research that we've found is that we
 

3151
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,190
research that we've found is that we
actually believe they have closer to

3152
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:42,200
actually believe they have closer to
 

3153
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,430
actually believe they have closer to
50,000 gpus we is sem so we should say

3154
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:45,440
50,000 gpus we is sem so we should say
 

3155
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,510
50,000 gpus we is sem so we should say
that you're uh sort of one of the world

3156
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
that you're uh sort of one of the world
 

3157
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,349
that you're uh sort of one of the world

like who's doing what in terms of
training runs so yeah so that's the Wii

3166
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,160
training runs so yeah so that's the Wii
 

3167
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,109
training runs so yeah so that's the Wii
okay go ahead yeah sorry sorry um we

3168
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:01,119
okay go ahead yeah sorry sorry um we
 

3169
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,029
okay go ahead yeah sorry sorry um we
believe they actually have something

3170
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:02,039
believe they actually have something
 

3171
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:04,390
believe they actually have something
closer to 50,000 gpus right now this is

3172
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
closer to 50,000 gpus right now this is
 

3173
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,829
closer to 50,000 gpus right now this is
this is split across many tasks right

3174
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:05,839
this is split across many tasks right
 

3175
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,309
this is split across many tasks right
again the fund um research in ablations

3176
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:09,319
again the fund um research in ablations
 

3177
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,870
again the fund um research in ablations
for ballpark how much would open AI or

3178
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:10,880
for ballpark how much would open AI or
 

3179
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,470
for ballpark how much would open AI or
anthropic had I think the clearest

3180
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:13,480
anthropic had I think the clearest
 

3181
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,990
anthropic had I think the clearest
example we have because meta is also

3182
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:15,000
example we have because meta is also
 

3183
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,349
example we have because meta is also
open they talk about like order of 60k

3184
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:17,359
open they talk about like order of 60k
 

3185
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,349
open they talk about like order of 60k
to 100K h100 equivalent gpus in their

3186
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:20,359
to 100K h100 equivalent gpus in their
 

3187
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:22,510
to 100K h100 equivalent gpus in their
training clusters right so so like llama

3188
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:22,520
training clusters right so so like llama
 

3189
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,190
training clusters right so so like llama
3 they said they trained on 16, h100s

3190
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:25,200
3 they said they trained on 16, h100s
 

3191
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,390
3 they said they trained on 16, h100s
right but the company of meta last year

3192
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:27,400
right but the company of meta last year
 

3193
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,109
right but the company of meta last year
publicly disclosed they bought like 400

3194
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:29,119
publicly disclosed they bought like 400
 

3195
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,150
publicly disclosed they bought like 400
something thousand gpus yeah right so so

3196
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:31,160
something thousand gpus yeah right so so
 

3197
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,630
something thousand gpus yeah right so so
of course Tiny percentage on the

3198
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
of course Tiny percentage on the
 

3199
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,230
of course Tiny percentage on the
training again like most of it is like

3200
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
training again like most of it is like
 

3201
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,990
training again like most of it is like
serving me the best Instagram reels

3202
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
serving me the best Instagram reels
 

3203
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,710
serving me the best Instagram reels
right um or whatever right I mean we

3204
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:37,720
right um or whatever right I mean we
 

3205
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,230
right um or whatever right I mean we
could get into a cost of like what is

3206
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:39,240
could get into a cost of like what is
 

3207
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,150
could get into a cost of like what is
the cost of ownership for a 2,000 GPU

3208
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:42,160
the cost of ownership for a 2,000 GPU
 

3209
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,549
the cost of ownership for a 2,000 GPU
cluster 10,000 like the there's just

3210
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:44,559
cluster 10,000 like the there's just
 

3211
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,990
cluster 10,000 like the there's just
different sizes of companies that can

3212
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
different sizes of companies that can
 

3213
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,309
different sizes of companies that can
afford these things and deep seek is

3214
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
afford these things and deep seek is
 

3215
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,470
afford these things and deep seek is
reasonably big their compute allocation

3216
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:51,480
reasonably big their compute allocation
 

3217
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,870
reasonably big their compute allocation
compared is one of the top few in the

3218
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
compared is one of the top few in the
 

3219
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,990
compared is one of the top few in the
world is not open Ai and Tropic Etc but

3220
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:57,000
world is not open Ai and Tropic Etc but
 

3221
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,309
world is not open Ai and Tropic Etc but
they have a lot of computer can you in

3222
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
they have a lot of computer can you in
 

3223
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,789
they have a lot of computer can you in
general actually just zoom out and also

3224
00:58:59,789 --> 00:58:59,799
general actually just zoom out and also
 

3225
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:01,710
general actually just zoom out and also
talk about the the hopper architecture

3226
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:01,720
talk about the the hopper architecture
 

3227
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,549
talk about the the hopper architecture
the Nvidia Hopper GPU architecture and

3228
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
the Nvidia Hopper GPU architecture and
 

3229
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,109
the Nvidia Hopper GPU architecture and
the difference between h100 and h800

3230
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:08,119
the difference between h100 and h800
 

3231
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,789
the difference between h100 and h800
like you mentioned the interconnects

3232
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:09,799
like you mentioned the interconnects
 

3233
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:11,029
like you mentioned the interconnects
yeah so there's you know Amper was the

3234
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:11,039
yeah so there's you know Amper was the
 

3235
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:13,789
yeah so there's you know Amper was the
a100 and then h100 Hopper right people

3236
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:13,799
a100 and then h100 Hopper right people
 

3237
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:16,230
a100 and then h100 Hopper right people
use them synonymously in the US because

3238
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
use them synonymously in the US because
 

3239
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,789
use them synonymously in the US because
really there's just h100 and now there's

3240
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:17,799
really there's just h100 and now there's
 

3241
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:21,069
really there's just h100 and now there's
h200 right but same thing uh mostly in

3242
00:59:21,069 --> 00:59:21,079
h200 right but same thing uh mostly in
 

3243
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,349
h200 right but same thing uh mostly in
China they've had two there have been

3244
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:22,359
China they've had two there have been
 

3245
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,549
China they've had two there have been
different salvos of export restrictions

3246
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
different salvos of export restrictions
 

3247
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,549
different salvos of export restrictions
so initially the US government limited

3248
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
so initially the US government limited
 

3249
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,549
so initially the US government limited
on a two- Factor scale right which is

3250
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
on a two- Factor scale right which is
 

3251
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,109
on a two- Factor scale right which is
Chip interconnect versus uh flops right

3252
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
Chip interconnect versus uh flops right
 

3253
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,990
Chip interconnect versus uh flops right
so any chip that had interconnects above

3254
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:33,000
so any chip that had interconnects above
 

3255
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,950
so any chip that had interconnects above
a certain level and flops above a

3256
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,960
a certain level and flops above a
 

3257
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,510
a certain level and flops above a
certain floating Point operations above

3258
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:36,520
certain floating Point operations above
 

3259
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,230
certain floating Point operations above
a certain level was restricted uh later

3260
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:39,240
a certain level was restricted uh later
 

3261
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,789
a certain level was restricted uh later
the government realized that this was a

3262
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
the government realized that this was a
 

3263
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,190
the government realized that this was a
flaw in the restriction and they cut it

3264
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
flaw in the restriction and they cut it
 

3265
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,349
flaw in the restriction and they cut it
down to just floating Point operations

3266
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:46,359
down to just floating Point operations
 

3267
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:50,710
down to just floating Point operations
and so um H h800 had high flops low

3268
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
and so um H h800 had high flops low
 

3269
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,829
and so um H h800 had high flops low
communication exactly so the h800 was

3270
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
communication exactly so the h800 was
 

3271
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,309
communication exactly so the h800 was
the same performance as h100 on flops

3272
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:56,319
the same performance as h100 on flops
 

3273
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,750
the same performance as h100 on flops
right but it didn't had it just had the

3274
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
right but it didn't had it just had the
 

3275
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,589
right but it didn't had it just had the
interconnect bandwidth cut deep seek

3276
00:59:59,589 --> 00:59:59,599
interconnect bandwidth cut deep seek
 

3277
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,510
interconnect bandwidth cut deep seek
knew how to utilize this you know hey

3278
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:02,520
knew how to utilize this you know hey
 

3279
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,630
knew how to utilize this you know hey
even though we were cut back on the

3280
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:03,640
even though we were cut back on the
 

3281
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,470
even though we were cut back on the
interconnect we can do all this fancy

3282
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:05,480
interconnect we can do all this fancy
 

3283
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,510
interconnect we can do all this fancy
stuff to figure out how to use the GPU

3284
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:07,520
stuff to figure out how to use the GPU
 

3285
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,710
stuff to figure out how to use the GPU
fully anyways right and and so that was

3286
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:10,720
fully anyways right and and so that was
 

3287
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,069
fully anyways right and and so that was
back in October 2022 but uh later in

3288
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
back in October 2022 but uh later in
 

3289
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,750
back in October 2022 but uh later in
2023 end of 2023 implemented in 2024 the

3290
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:17,760
2023 end of 2023 implemented in 2024 the
 

3291
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,270
2023 end of 2023 implemented in 2024 the
US government banned the h800 right um

3292
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:20,280
US government banned the h800 right um
 

3293
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,829
US government banned the h800 right um
and so by the way this h800 cluster

3294
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
and so by the way this h800 cluster
 

3295
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,870
and so by the way this h800 cluster
these 2,000 gpus was not even purchased

3296
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:23,880
these 2,000 gpus was not even purchased
 

3297
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,910
these 2,000 gpus was not even purchased
in 2024 right it's purchased in late 202

3298
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:26,920
in 2024 right it's purchased in late 202
 

3299
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,470
in 2024 right it's purchased in late 202
um and they're just getting the model

3300
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:28,480
um and they're just getting the model
 

3301
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,789
um and they're just getting the model
out now right because it takes a lot of

3302
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:29,799
out now right because it takes a lot of
 

3303
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:32,549
out now right because it takes a lot of
research Etc um h800 was banned and now

3304
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
research Etc um h800 was banned and now
 

3305
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,870
research Etc um h800 was banned and now
there's a new chip called the H20 uh the

3306
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:34,880
there's a new chip called the H20 uh the
 

3307
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,270
there's a new chip called the H20 uh the
H20 is uh cut back on only flops but the

3308
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:38,280
H20 is uh cut back on only flops but the
 

3309
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,029
H20 is uh cut back on only flops but the
interconnect bandwidth is the same and

3310
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:40,039
interconnect bandwidth is the same and
 

3311
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:41,829
interconnect bandwidth is the same and
in fact in some ways it's better than

3312
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:41,839
in fact in some ways it's better than
 

3313
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,630
in fact in some ways it's better than
the h100 because it has better memory

3314
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:43,640
the h100 because it has better memory
 

3315
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,710
the h100 because it has better memory
bandwidth and memory capacity so there

3316
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:45,720
bandwidth and memory capacity so there
 

3317
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,309
bandwidth and memory capacity so there
are you know Nvidia is working within

3318
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:47,319
are you know Nvidia is working within
 

3319
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:48,670
are you know Nvidia is working within
the constraints of what the government

3320
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:48,680
the constraints of what the government

01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,990
the constraints of what the government
sets and then get builds the best

01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:52,880
possible GPU for China can we take this
 

3325
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,829
possible GPU for China can we take this
actual tangent and we'll return back to

controls the case he makes is that if AI

3336
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:08,039
controls the case he makes is that if AI
 

3337
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,510

01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:10,520
becomes super powerful and he says by
 

3339
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,750
becomes super powerful and he says by
2026 we'll have AGI or super powerful Ai

3340
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:13,760
2026 we'll have AGI or super powerful Ai
 

3341
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,309
2026 we'll have AGI or super powerful Ai
and that's going to give a significant

3342
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:15,319
and that's going to give a significant
 

3343

01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,230
whoever builds that will have a
significant military advantage and so

3346
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:20,240
significant military advantage and so
 

3347
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,910
significant military advantage and so
because the United States is is a

3348
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920
because the United States is is a
 

3349
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,150
because the United States is is a
democracy and as he says China is uh

3350
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,160
democracy and as he says China is uh
 

3351
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,470
democracy and as he says China is uh
authoritarian or has authoritarian

01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:34,920
the super powerful military because of
 

3357
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,589
the super powerful military because of
the AI is one that's a democracy it's a

3358
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
the AI is one that's a democracy it's a
 

3359
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,589
the AI is one that's a democracy it's a
much more complicated world

3360
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
much more complicated world
 

3361
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,750
much more complicated world
geopolitically when you have two

3362
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:41,760
geopolitically when you have two
 

3363
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,910
geopolitically when you have two
superpowers with super powerful Ai and

3364
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:44,920
superpowers with super powerful Ai and
 

3365
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,270
superpowers with super powerful Ai and
one is authoritarian so that's the case

3366
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
one is authoritarian so that's the case
 

3367
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,430
one is authoritarian so that's the case
he makes and so we want to uh the United

he makes and so we want to uh the United
 

3369
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,150

3371
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,029

01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,230
be able to cut everything off right uh
and that's that's like I think that's

everything off um you know and they'll
 

3525
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,589
everything off um you know and they'll
make their own chips and and they're

3526
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:42,599
make their own chips and and they're
 

3527
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:43,510
make their own chips and and they're
trying to make their own chips they'll

trying to make their own chips they'll
 

3529
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,950
trying to make their own chips they'll
be worse than ours but you know this is

3530
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:44,960
be worse than ours but you know this is
 

3531
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,630
be worse than ours but you know this is
the whole point is to just keep a gap

3735
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,110
a next step that's great if we get these

like that work and I think it's more
 

3867
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,870
like that work and I think it's more

likely that we have breakthroughs that
 

3869

3877
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,030
of describing this and I just think that
it's like there's going to be more than

it's monitored by a lot of researchers
 

4039
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,110
it's monitored by a lot of researchers
to see what's happening I think the

4040
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,120
to see what's happening I think the
 

4041
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,149
to see what's happening I think the
you're asking about like the AGI thing I

4042
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
you're asking about like the AGI thing I
 

4043
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,510
you're asking about like the AGI thing I
my if you make me give a year I would be

01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:46,520
my if you make me give a year I would be
 

4045

my if you make me give a year I would be
like okay I have ai CEOs saying this

4046
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:48,440
like okay I have ai CEOs saying this
 

4047
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,709
like okay I have ai CEOs saying this
they've been saying two years for a

4048
01:13:49,709 --> 01:13:49,719
they've been saying two years for a
 

4049
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:52,870
they've been saying two years for a
while I think that they're people like

4050
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,880
while I think that they're people like
 

4051
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,110

Dario anthropic the had thought about

4052
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:56,120
Dario anthropic the had thought about
 

4053
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,830
Dario anthropic the had thought about
this so deeply I need to take their

4054
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:58,840
this so deeply I need to take their
 

4055
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,709
this so deeply I need to take their
words seriously but also understand that

4056
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
words seriously but also understand that
 

4057
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,590
words seriously but also understand that
they have differ different incentive so

4058
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:03,600
they have differ different incentive so
 

4059
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,149
they have differ different incentive so
I would be like add a few years to that

4060
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:05,159
I would be like add a few years to that
 

4061
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:06,310
I would be like add a few years to that
which is how you get something similar

4062
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
which is how you get something similar
 

4063
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,709
which is how you get something similar
to 2030 or a little after 2030 I think

4064
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:08,719
to 2030 or a little after 2030 I think
 

4065
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,790
to 2030 or a little after 2030 I think
to some extent we have capabilities that

4066
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
to some extent we have capabilities that
 

4067
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,350
to some extent we have capabilities that
hit a certain point where any one person

4068
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
hit a certain point where any one person
 

4069
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,229
hit a certain point where any one person
could say oh okay if I can leverage

4070
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:15,239
could say oh okay if I can leverage
 

4071
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:17,390
could say oh okay if I can leverage
those capabilities for x amount of time

4072
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:17,400
those capabilities for x amount of time
 

4073
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,550
those capabilities for x amount of time
this is Agi right call it 2728 but then

4074
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,560
this is Agi right call it 2728 but then
 

4075
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,510
this is Agi right call it 2728 but then
the cost of actually operating that

4076
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:22,520
the cost of actually operating that
 

4077
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,070
the cost of actually operating that
capability yeah this is going to be my

4078
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
capability yeah this is going to be my
 

4079
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,669
capability yeah this is going to be my
point so so extreme that no one can

4080
01:14:26,669 --> 01:14:26,679
point so so extreme that no one can
 

4081
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:29,590
point so so extreme that no one can
actually deploy it at scale and Mass to

4082
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:29,600
actually deploy it at scale and Mass to
 

4083
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,430
actually deploy it at scale and Mass to
actually completely revolutionize the

4084
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
actually completely revolutionize the
 

4085
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,189
actually completely revolutionize the
economy on a click on a snap of a finger

4086
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:33,199
economy on a click on a snap of a finger
 

4087
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,790
economy on a click on a snap of a finger
so I don't think it will be like a snap

4088
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
so I don't think it will be like a snap
 

4089
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,750
so I don't think it will be like a snap
of the finger moment physical constraint

4090
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:36,760

more complicated problems but the cost

4148
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
more complicated problems but the cost
 

4149
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,550
more complicated problems but the cost
is going to be measured in thousands and

4150
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
is going to be measured in thousands and
 

4151
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,270
is going to be measured in thousands and
thousands and hundreds of thousands of

thousands and hundreds of thousands of
 

4153
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,470
thousands and hundreds of thousands of
dollars of GPU time and there just won't

4154
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
dollars of GPU time and there just won't
 

4155
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,149
dollars of GPU time and there just won't
be enough power gpus infrastructure to

4156
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:49,159
be enough power gpus infrastructure to
 

4157
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:50,629
be enough power gpus infrastructure to
operate this and therefore shift

4158
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:50,639
operate this and therefore shift
 

4159
01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:51,830
operate this and therefore shift
everything in the world on the snap the

4160
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
everything in the world on the snap the
 

4161
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,590
everything in the world on the snap the
finger but at that moment who gets to

4162
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:54,600
finger but at that moment who gets to
 

4163
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,390
finger but at that moment who gets to
constu control and point the AGI at a

4164
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
constu control and point the AGI at a
 

4165
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,390
constu control and point the AGI at a
task and so this was in Dario's post

4166
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
task and so this was in Dario's post
 

4167
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,510
task and so this was in Dario's post
that he's like hey China can effectively

01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:02,520
that he's like hey China can effectively
 

4169
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,510
that he's like hey China can effectively
and more quickly than us Point their AGI

4170
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
and more quickly than us Point their AGI
 

4171
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,750
and more quickly than us Point their AGI
at military tasks right and they have

4172
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
at military tasks right and they have
 

4173
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,830
at military tasks right and they have
been in many ways faster at adopting

4174
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:09,840
been in many ways faster at adopting
 

4175
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,470
been in many ways faster at adopting

arms such as drones they've they
completely leapfrogged the US and the

4190
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
completely leapfrogged the US and the
 

4191
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,910
completely leapfrogged the US and the
west and the the fear that Dario is sort

4192
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:29,920
west and the the fear that Dario is sort
 

4193
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,629
west and the the fear that Dario is sort
of pointing out there I think is that

4194
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:32,639
of pointing out there I think is that
 

4195
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,070
of pointing out there I think is that
yeah great we'll have AGI in the

4196
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
yeah great we'll have AGI in the
 

4197
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,350
yeah great we'll have AGI in the
commercial sector uh the US military

4198
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:36,360
commercial sector uh the US military
 

4199
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,270
commercial sector uh the US military
won't be able to implement it super fast

4200
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:38,280
won't be able to implement it super fast
 

4201
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,709
won't be able to implement it super fast
Chinese military could and they could

4202
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:39,719
Chinese military could and they could
 

4203
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:41,270
Chinese military could and they could
direct all their resources to

4204
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:41,280
direct all their resources to
 

4205
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,910
direct all their resources to
implementing it in the military and

4206
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:42,920
implementing it in the military and
 

4207
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,149
implementing it in the military and
therefore solving you know military

4208
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:45,159
therefore solving you know military
 

4209

targeted certain set of people so they
 

4215
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,390
targeted certain set of people so they
can flip a country's politics or

can flip a country's politics or
 

4217

something like that that is actually
 

4219
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,390
something like that that is actually
like catastrophic versus you know the US

4220
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400
like catastrophic versus you know the US
 

4221
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,110
like catastrophic versus you know the US
just wants to you know because it'll be

than it is similar with drones here I

4242
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
than it is similar with drones here I
 

4243
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,590
than it is similar with drones here I
understand it a little bit less but I've

4244

understand it a little bit less but I've
 

4245
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,310
understand it a little bit less but I've
just seen the reality of the war in

just seen the reality of the war in
 

4247
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,830
just seen the reality of the war in
Ukraine and the usage of drones on both

Ukraine and the usage of drones on both
 

4249
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,390
Ukraine and the usage of drones on both
sides and it seems that humans still far

outperforms AI system so I think it's
 

4261
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:46,270

not obvious to me that we're going to

I think going going back to my viewpoint
is if you believe we're in the sort of

is if you believe we're in the sort of

then the only way to sort of like create
 

4349
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,229
then the only way to sort of like create

01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:47,719
something that's constraining right
 

4357
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:49,430
something that's constraining right
China arguably has more Talent right

4358
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:49,440
China arguably has more Talent right
 

4359
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,830
China arguably has more Talent right
more stem graduates more programmers the

foreigners in the AI industry so many of

4366
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:57,719
foreigners in the AI industry so many of
 

4367
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:00,149
foreigners in the AI industry so many of
these AI teams are all people without a

US passport yeah yeah I mean many of

4370
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:03,239
US passport yeah yeah I mean many of
 

4371
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:05,030
US passport yeah yeah I mean many of
them are are are Chinese people who are

4372
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
them are are are Chinese people who are
 

4373
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,590
them are are are Chinese people who are
moving to America right and that's

4374
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:06,600
moving to America right and that's
 

4375
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,030
moving to America right and that's
that's great that's exactly what we want

4376
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:08,040
that's great that's exactly what we want
 

4377
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,270
that's great that's exactly what we want
right um but there's that Talent is one

4378
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
right um but there's that Talent is one
 

4379
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,750
right um but there's that Talent is one
aspect but I don't think that's one that

4380
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:12,760
aspect but I don't think that's one that
 

4381
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,590
aspect but I don't think that's one that
is a measurable Advantage for the us or

4382
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:14,600
is a measurable Advantage for the us or
 

4383
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,990
is a measurable Advantage for the us or
not it truly is just whether or not

4384
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:17,000
not it truly is just whether or not
 

4385
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,189
not it truly is just whether or not

4427
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,510
largest data center in the world if they
had access to the chips could so it's

4428

had access to the chips could so it's
 

4429
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,790
had access to the chips could so it's
not just it's just a question of uh when

4500
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,600
than the rest of the world to make the
 

4501
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,709
than the rest of the world to make the
chips because everybody can buy they're

4502
01:22:19,709 --> 01:22:19,719
chips because everybody can buy they're
 

4503
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:21,070
chips because everybody can buy they're
going to sell their Chinese Chips to

4504
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:21,080
going to sell their Chinese Chips to
 

4505
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,149
going to sell their Chinese Chips to
everybody they might subsidize them and

01:22:23,149 --> 01:22:23,159
everybody they might subsidize them and
 

4507
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:25,390
everybody they might subsidize them and
therefore if AI takes a long time to

4508
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:25,400
therefore if AI takes a long time to
 

4509
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,550
therefore if AI takes a long time to
become differentiated we've knapped the

4510
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:27,560
become differentiated we've knapped the
 

4511
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,990
become differentiated we've knapped the

cannot sell to China so therefore we

4516
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:34,719
cannot sell to China so therefore we
 

4517
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,550
cannot sell to China so therefore we
have less demand to therefore in to like

4518
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
have less demand to therefore in to like
 

4519
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,270
have less demand to therefore in to like

because of these restrictions long term

4528
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:49,080
because of these restrictions long term
 

4529
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,510
because of these restrictions long term
unless AI does something in the short

4530
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:51,520
unless AI does something in the short
 

4531
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,910
unless AI does something in the short
term which I believe AI will do you know

4532
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:53,920
term which I believe AI will do you know

convinced that this is the way that this
 

4577
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,990
convinced that this is the way that this
is what they're doing but if China

is what they're doing but if China
 

4579
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,189
is what they're doing but if China
decided to they could do it faster than

the export restrictions come in and say

4626
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:35,000
the export restrictions come in and say
 

4627
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,270
the export restrictions come in and say
hey you can't you can't ship the most

powerful us chips to China uh you can
 

4631
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,629
powerful us chips to China uh you can
ship a cutdown version you can you can't

4632
01:24:41,629 --> 01:24:41,639
ship a cutdown version you can you can't
 

4633

these countries who we know are just
 

4637
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,669
these countries who we know are just
going to rent it to China uh you have to

4638
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
going to rent it to China uh you have to
 

4639
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,950
going to rent it to China uh you have to
limit the numbers right and the tools

4640
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:49,960
limit the numbers right and the tools
 

4641
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,550
limit the numbers right and the tools
and same with manufacturing equipment

4642
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:51,560
and same with manufacturing equipment
 

4643
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,270
and same with manufacturing equipment
tools all these all these different

4644
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:53,280
tools all these all these different
 

4645
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,910
tools all these all these different
aspects but stems from Ai and then what

4646
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:55,920
aspects but stems from Ai and then what
 

4647
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,470
aspects but stems from Ai and then what
Downstream can slow them down in Ai and

4648
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,480
Downstream can slow them down in Ai and
 

4649
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,950
Downstream can slow them down in Ai and
so the the entire semiconductor

4650
01:24:59,950 --> 01:24:59,960
so the the entire semiconductor
 

4651
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,149
so the the entire semiconductor
restrictions you read them they are very

01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
Google did before Nvidia did and they
 

4701
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,590
Google did before Nvidia did and they
submitted it to The mlpf Benchmark which

4702
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
submitted it to The mlpf Benchmark which
 

4703
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,629
submitted it to The mlpf Benchmark which
is sort of a industry standard for

01:26:03,629 --> 01:26:03,639
um and and it did quite well and it was
 

4709
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:05,590
um and and it did quite well and it was
the best chip at the submission right

4710
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,600
the best chip at the submission right
 

4711
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,310
the best chip at the submission right
this was this was a huge deal um the

4712
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:08,320
this was this was a huge deal um the
 

4713
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,870
this was this was a huge deal um the
Trump admin of course banned um it was

4714
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:10,880
Trump admin of course banned um it was
 

4715
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,030
Trump admin of course banned um it was
2019 right banned the Huawei from

4716
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
2019 right banned the Huawei from
 

4717
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,550
2019 right banned the Huawei from
getting 7 nanometer chips from tsmc and

4718
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:15,560
getting 7 nanometer chips from tsmc and
 

4719
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,109
getting 7 nanometer chips from tsmc and
so then they had to switch to move using

4720
01:26:17,109 --> 01:26:17,119
so then they had to switch to move using
 

4721
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:18,830
so then they had to switch to move using
internal domestically produced chips

4722
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:18,840
internal domestically produced chips
 

4723
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,430
internal domestically produced chips
which was a multi-year setback many

4724
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:20,440
which was a multi-year setback many
 

4725
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,990
which was a multi-year setback many
companies have done seven nanometer

4726
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:22,000
companies have done seven nanometer
 

4727
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,590
companies have done seven nanometer
chips and the question is like we don't

4728
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
chips and the question is like we don't
 

4729
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,750
chips and the question is like we don't
know how much

4730
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:24,760
know how much
 

4731
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,430
know how much
Huawei was subsidizing production of

4732
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:26,440
Huawei was subsidizing production of
 

4733
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,510
Huawei was subsidizing production of
that chip like Intel has made Seven

4734
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:28,520
that chip like Intel has made Seven
 

4735
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,870
that chip like Intel has made Seven
nanometer chips that are not profitable

4736
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:30,880
nanometer chips that are not profitable
 

4737
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,390
nanometer chips that are not profitable
and things like this so this is how it

4738
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:32,400
and things like this so this is how it
 

4739
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,669
and things like this so this is how it
all feeds back into the economic engine

4740
01:26:34,669 --> 01:26:34,679
all feeds back into the economic engine
 

4741
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:37,270
all feeds back into the economic engine
of export controls well so you're saying

4742
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
of export controls well so you're saying
 

4743
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,470
of export controls well so you're saying
that for now xiin Bing has not felt the

4744
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:40,480
that for now xiin Bing has not felt the
 

4745
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,510
that for now xiin Bing has not felt the
AGI but it feels like the Deep seek

4746
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:42,520
AGI but it feels like the Deep seek
 

4747
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:46,149
AGI but it feels like the Deep seek
moment yeah might like there might be

4748
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
moment yeah might like there might be
 

4749
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,149
moment yeah might like there might be
meetings going on now where he's going

4750
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
meetings going on now where he's going
 

4751
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,830

to start wearing the same t-shirt and

4752
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:50,840
to start wearing the same t-shirt and
 

4753
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,669
to start wearing the same t-shirt and
things are going to escalate I mean like

4754
01:26:52,669 --> 01:26:52,679
things are going to escalate I mean like
 

4755
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,229
things are going to escalate I mean like
like this he may have woken up last week

4756
01:26:55,229 --> 01:26:55,239
like this he may have woken up last week
 

4757
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:57,629
like this he may have woken up last week
right Leon Fang met the vice chair Vice

4758
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:57,639
right Leon Fang met the vice chair Vice
 

4759
01:26:57,639 --> 01:26:59,709
right Leon Fang met the vice chair Vice
the second command guy um and they had a

4760
01:26:59,709 --> 01:26:59,719
the second command guy um and they had a
 

4761
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:01,990
the second command guy um and they had a
meeting and then the day the next day

4762
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:02,000
meeting and then the day the next day
 

4763
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,390
meeting and then the day the next day
they announced the AI subsidies which

4764
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:03,400
they announced the AI subsidies which
 

4765
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,189
they announced the AI subsidies which
are trillion R&B right so it's possible

4766
01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:06,199
are trillion R&B right so it's possible
 

4767
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:08,470
are trillion R&B right so it's possible
that this deep seek moment is truly the

4768
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:08,480
that this deep seek moment is truly the
 

4769
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,950
that this deep seek moment is truly the
beginning of a cold war that's what a

4770
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,960
beginning of a cold war that's what a
 

4771
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,590
beginning of a cold war that's what a
lot of people are worried about people

4772
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:12,600
lot of people are worried about people
 

4773
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,470
lot of people are worried about people
in AI have been worried that this is

4774
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
in AI have been worried that this is
 

4775
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,310
in AI have been worried that this is
going towards a cold war or already is

4776
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:16,320
going towards a cold war or already is
 

4777
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,189
going towards a cold war or already is
but there was it's not deep seeks fault

4778
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:18,199
but there was it's not deep seeks fault
 

4779
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,669
but there was it's not deep seeks fault
but there's something a bunch of factors

4780
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:20,679
but there's something a bunch of factors
 

4781
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:23,109
but there's something a bunch of factors
came together where it was explosion I

4782
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:23,119
came together where it was explosion I
 

4783
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:24,790
came together where it was explosion I
mean it all has to do with stop going

4784
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:24,800
mean it all has to do with stop going
 

4785
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,830
mean it all has to do with stop going
down prob but it's just some like Mass

4786
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:28,840
down prob but it's just some like Mass
 

4787
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,270
down prob but it's just some like Mass
hysteria that happened that eventually

4788
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:31,280
hysteria that happened that eventually
 

4789
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,390

01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:33,400
led to shing ping having meetings and
 

4791
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,270
led to shing ping having meetings and
waking up to this idea and the US

4792
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
waking up to this idea and the US
 

4793
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,470

and shocked everyone and it was very

4800
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
and shocked everyone and it was very
 

4801
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,550
and shocked everyone and it was very
clearly aimed at AI everyone was like

Taiwan this is this is the big risk
 

4829
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,669
Taiwan this is this is the big risk
right the further you push China away

4830
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:18,679
right the further you push China away
 

4831
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:21,149
right the further you push China away
from having access to you cutting edge

4832
01:28:21,149 --> 01:28:21,159
from having access to you cutting edge
 

4833
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:23,510
from having access to you cutting edge
American and Global Technologies the

4834
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:23,520
American and Global Technologies the
 

4835
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,310
American and Global Technologies the
more likely they are to say well well

4836
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:25,320
more likely they are to say well well
 

4837
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,149
more likely they are to say well well
cuz I can't access it I might as well

4838
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:27,159
cuz I can't access it I might as well
 

4839
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:29,030
cuz I can't access it I might as well
like no one should access it right um

4840
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,040
like no one should access it right um
 

4841
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,510
like no one should access it right um
and there's a few like interesting

4842
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:30,520
and there's a few like interesting
 

4843
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,350
and there's a few like interesting
aspects of that right like you know

4844
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:32,360
aspects of that right like you know
 

4845
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,950
aspects of that right like you know
China has a urban rural divide like no

ratio like no other to the point where
 

4851
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,310
ratio like no other to the point where
you know if you look in most of China

4852
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
you know if you look in most of China
 

4853
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,470
you know if you look in most of China
it's like the ratio is not that bad but

4854
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:43,480
it's like the ratio is not that bad but
 

4855
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,870
it's like the ratio is not that bad but
when you look at single dudes in rural

China it's like a 30 to1 ratio um and
those are disenfranchised dudes right

4860
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:49,440
those are disenfranchised dudes right
 

4861
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,550
those are disenfranchised dudes right
like uh quote unquote like the US has an

01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:51,560
like uh quote unquote like the US has an
 

4863
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,669

technology at least the US thinks so
 

4875
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,229
technology at least the US thinks so
China is maybe starting to think this is

4876
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
China is maybe starting to think this is
 

4877
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,910
China is maybe starting to think this is
the most important technology uh by

4878
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
the most important technology uh by
 

4879
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,310
the most important technology uh by
starting to dump subsidies in it right

4880
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:07,320
starting to dump subsidies in it right
 

4881
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,790
starting to dump subsidies in it right
they thought EVs and Renewables were the

4882

they thought EVs and Renewables were the
 

4883
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,470
they thought EVs and Renewables were the
most important technology they dominate

to they started thinking about that
 

4889
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,990
to they started thinking about that
about semiconductors in you know the

4890
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:15,000
about semiconductors in you know the
 

4891
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,189
about semiconductors in you know the
late 2010s and early 2020s and now

4892
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:18,199
late 2010s and early 2020s and now

they've been dumping money and they're
 

4895
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:21,390
they've been dumping money and they're
catching up rapidly um and they're going

4896
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:21,400
catching up rapidly um and they're going
 

4897
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,070
catching up rapidly um and they're going
to do the same with AI right because

4898
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,080
to do the same with AI right because
 

4899
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,030
to do the same with AI right because
they're very talented right so so uh the

4900
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:26,040
they're very talented right so so uh the
 

4901
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,109
they're very talented right so so uh the
the question is like when when does when

4902
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:29,119
the question is like when when does when
 

4903
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:30,750
the question is like when when does when
when does when does this hit a Breaking

4904
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:30,760
when does when does this hit a Breaking
 

4905
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:34,950
when does when does this hit a Breaking
Point right um and if China sees this as

4906
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:34,960
Point right um and if China sees this as
 

4907
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,149
Point right um and if China sees this as
hey they can continue if they if not

4908
01:29:37,149 --> 01:29:37,159
hey they can continue if they if not
 

4909
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:38,870
hey they can continue if they if not
having access and starting a true Hot

4910
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:38,880
having access and starting a true Hot
 

4911
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,189

War right taking over Taiwan or trying

4912
01:29:41,189 --> 01:29:41,199
War right taking over Taiwan or trying
 

4913
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,669
War right taking over Taiwan or trying
to subvert its democracy in some way or

4914

to subvert its democracy in some way or
 

4915
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,030
to subvert its democracy in some way or
blockading it um hurts the rest of the

4916
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:46,040
blockading it um hurts the rest of the
 

4917
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,189
blockading it um hurts the rest of the
world far more than it hurts them this

4918
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:48,199
world far more than it hurts them this
 

4919
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:49,990
world far more than it hurts them this
is something they could potentially do

4920
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
is something they could potentially do
 

4921
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,990
is something they could potentially do
right and and so is this pushing them

4922
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:52,000
right and and so is this pushing them
 

4923
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,430
right and and so is this pushing them
towards that uh potentially right I'm

4924
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:54,440
towards that uh potentially right I'm
 

4925
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,070
towards that uh potentially right I'm
not quite a geopolitical person but you

4926
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:57,080
not quite a geopolitical person but you
 

4927
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,390
not quite a geopolitical person but you
know it it's it's obvious that the world

4928
01:29:59,390 --> 01:29:59,400
know it it's it's obvious that the world
 

4929
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,870
know it it's it's obvious that the world
regime of peace and like trade is like

4930
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:02,880
regime of peace and like trade is like
 

4931
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,510
regime of peace and like trade is like
super awesome for economics uh but but

4932
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:05,520
super awesome for economics uh but but
 

4933
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,950
super awesome for economics uh but but
at some point it could break right I

4934
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:06,960
at some point it could break right I
 

4935
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,550
at some point it could break right I
think we should comment that the like

4936
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:08,560
think we should comment that the like
 

4937
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,470
think we should comment that the like
why Chinese economy would be hurt by

4938
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
why Chinese economy would be hurt by
 

4939
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,430
why Chinese economy would be hurt by
that is that their export heavy I think

4940
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:12,440
that is that their export heavy I think
 

4941
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,830
that is that their export heavy I think
the United States Buys so much like if

4942
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:14,840
the United States Buys so much like if
 

4943
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,070
the United States Buys so much like if
that goes away like that's how their

4944
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
that goes away like that's how their
 

4945
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,669
that goes away like that's how their
economy well also also they just like

4946
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
economy well also also they just like
 

4947
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,629
economy well also also they just like
would not be able to import raw

4948
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:19,639
would not be able to import raw
 

4949
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:21,430
would not be able to import raw
materials from like all over the world

4950
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,440
materials from like all over the world
 

4951
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,950
materials from like all over the world
right the US would just shut down the

4952
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:22,960
right the US would just shut down the
 

4953
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,669
right the US would just shut down the
straight of malaka and like you know at

4954
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:24,679
straight of malaka and like you know at
 

4955
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:26,870
straight of malaka and like you know at
the same time the US entire Like You

4956
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:26,880
the same time the US entire Like You
 

4957
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,030
the same time the US entire Like You
could argue almost all the GDP growth in

4958
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,040
could argue almost all the GDP growth in
 

4959
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,149
could argue almost all the GDP growth in

01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:35,000
every two years there there's a separate
 

5081
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,189
every two years there there's a separate
law that's sort of like doubling the

law that's sort of like doubling the
 

5083
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:38,270
law that's sort of like doubling the
cost of Fabs every handful of years and

cost of Fabs every handful of years and
 

5085
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,629
cost of Fabs every handful of years and
so you look at a Leading Edge Fab that

5086
01:32:40,629 --> 01:32:40,639
so you look at a Leading Edge Fab that
 

5087
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,109
so you look at a Leading Edge Fab that
is going to be profitable today that's

5088
01:32:42,109 --> 01:32:42,119
is going to be profitable today that's
 

5089
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:43,350
is going to be profitable today that's

or two nanometer chips in the future

5092
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:45,040
or two nanometer chips in the future
 

5093
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,390
or two nanometer chips in the future
that's going to cost north of 3040

5094
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:47,400
that's going to cost north of 3040
 

5095
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,709
that's going to cost north of 3040
billion right um and that's just for

5096
01:32:49,709 --> 01:32:49,719
billion right um and that's just for
 

5097
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:51,550
billion right um and that's just for
like a token amount that's for like

5098
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:51,560
like a token amount that's for like
 

5099
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,629
like a token amount that's for like
that's like the base building block and

5100
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
that's like the base building block and
 

5101
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:53,669
that's like the base building block and
you probably need to build multiple

5102
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:53,679
you probably need to build multiple
 

5103
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,669
you probably need to build multiple
right and so when you look at the

5104
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:55,679
right and so when you look at the
 

5105
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,870
right and so when you look at the
industry uh over the last you know if I

5106
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:57,880
industry uh over the last you know if I
 

5107
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,629

go back 20 30 years ago there were 2030

5108
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
go back 20 30 years ago there were 2030
 

5109
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,950
go back 20 30 years ago there were 2030
companies that could build the most

5110
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:01,960
companies that could build the most
 

5111
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,310
companies that could build the most
advanced chips and then they would

5112
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:03,320
advanced chips and then they would
 

5113
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,669
advanced chips and then they would
design them themselves and sell them

5114
01:33:04,669 --> 01:33:04,679
design them themselves and sell them
 

5115
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,189
design them themselves and sell them
right so companies like AMD would build

5116
01:33:06,189 --> 01:33:06,199
right so companies like AMD would build
 

5117
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:08,109
right so companies like AMD would build
their own chips uh Intel of course still

5118
01:33:08,109 --> 01:33:08,119
their own chips uh Intel of course still
 

5119
01:33:08,119 --> 01:33:08,990
their own chips uh Intel of course still
builds their own chips they're very

5120
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:09,000
builds their own chips they're very
 

5121
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,310
builds their own chips they're very
famous for but IBM would build their own

5122
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
famous for but IBM would build their own
 

5123
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,270
famous for but IBM would build their own
chips and you know you could keep going

5124
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:12,280
chips and you know you could keep going
 

5125
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,550

01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,560
down the list all these companies built
 

5127
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,030
down the list all these companies built
their own chips slowly they kept falling

5128
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:16,040
their own chips slowly they kept falling
 

5129
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,390
their own chips slowly they kept falling
like flies and that's because of what

5130
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:17,400
like flies and that's because of what
 

5131
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,149

I mean like like I mentioned right the

5200
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:28,480
I mean like like I mentioned right the
 

5201
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,149
I mean like like I mentioned right the
cost of building a Fab is so high the

R&D is so difficult um and uh when you

5204
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
R&D is so difficult um and uh when you
 

5205
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,470
R&D is so difficult um and uh when you
look at like these like companies that

5206
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:35,480
look at like these like companies that
 

5207
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,310
look at like these like companies that
had their own vertical stack there was

5208

Penny like chips in there right anyway
so so as you have more diversity of

5270
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:33,880
so so as you have more diversity of
 

5271
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:35,709
so so as you have more diversity of
chips as you have more specialization

5272
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:35,719
chips as you have more specialization
 

5273
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:37,870
chips as you have more specialization
required and the cost of Fabs continues

5274
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:37,880
required and the cost of Fabs continues
 

5275
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,229
required and the cost of Fabs continues
to grow you need someone who is laser

5276
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:40,239
to grow you need someone who is laser
 

5277
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,350
to grow you need someone who is laser
focused on building the best process

5278
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:42,360
focused on building the best process
 

5279
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,030
focused on building the best process
technology and making it as flexible as

5280
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,040
technology and making it as flexible as
 

5281
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,950
technology and making it as flexible as
possible I I think you can say it simply

5282
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
possible I I think you can say it simply
 

5283
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,189
possible I I think you can say it simply
which is the cost for Fab goes up and if

5284
01:35:50,189 --> 01:35:50,199
which is the cost for Fab goes up and if
 

5285
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:52,109
which is the cost for Fab goes up and if
you are a small player that makes a few

5286
01:35:52,109 --> 01:35:52,119
you are a small player that makes a few
 

5287
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:53,790
you are a small player that makes a few
types of chips you're not going to can

5288
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:53,800
types of chips you're not going to can
 

5289
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,830
types of chips you're not going to can
have the demand to pay back the cost of

5290
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,840
have the demand to pay back the cost of
 

5291
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,070
have the demand to pay back the cost of
the Fab whereas Nvidia can have many

5292
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
the Fab whereas Nvidia can have many
 

5293
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,390
the Fab whereas Nvidia can have many
different customers and aggregate all

5294
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,400
different customers and aggregate all
 

5295
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,109
different customers and aggregate all
this demand into one place and then

5296
01:36:02,109 --> 01:36:02,119
this demand into one place and then
 

5297
01:36:02,119 --> 01:36:03,950
this demand into one place and then
they're the only person that makes

5298
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:03,960
they're the only person that makes
 

5299
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,470
they're the only person that makes
enough money building chips to buy the

5300
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:06,480
enough money building chips to buy the
 

5301
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,070
enough money building chips to buy the
next to build the next Fab so this is

5302
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:09,080
next to build the next Fab so this is
 

5303
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,709
next to build the next Fab so this is
kind of why they the companies slowly

5304
01:36:10,709 --> 01:36:10,719
kind of why they the companies slowly
 

5305
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:13,470
kind of why they the companies slowly
get killed because they have a they have

5306
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:13,480
get killed because they have a they have
 

5307
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,750
get killed because they have a they have
10 years ago a chip that is profitable

5308
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:15,760
10 years ago a chip that is profitable
 

5309
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,229
10 years ago a chip that is profitable
and is good enough but the cost to build

5310
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:17,239
and is good enough but the cost to build
 

5311
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,470
and is good enough but the cost to build
the next one goes up they may try to do

5312
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:19,480
the next one goes up they may try to do
 

5313
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,229
the next one goes up they may try to do
this fail because they don't have the

5314
01:36:21,229 --> 01:36:21,239
this fail because they don't have the
 

5315
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:22,390
this fail because they don't have the
money to make it work and then they

5316
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:22,400
money to make it work and then they
 

5317
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,870
money to make it work and then they
don't have any chips or they build it

5318
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:23,880
don't have any chips or they build it
 

5319
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,870
don't have any chips or they build it
and it's too expensive and they just

5320
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:25,880
and it's too expensive and they just
 

5321
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,109
and it's too expensive and they just
have you there's more failure points

5322
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:28,119
have you there's more failure points
 

5323
01:36:28,119 --> 01:36:29,990
have you there's more failure points
right you know you could have one little

5324
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:30,000
right you know you could have one little
 

5325
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,990
right you know you could have one little
process related to like some sort of

5326
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,000
process related to like some sort of
 

5327
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,070
process related to like some sort of
like uh chemical etch or some sort of

5328
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:34,080
like uh chemical etch or some sort of
 

5329
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,109
like uh chemical etch or some sort of
like plasma etch or you know some little

5330
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:36,119
like plasma etch or you know some little
 

5331
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:37,750
like plasma etch or you know some little
process that screws up you didn't

5332
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:37,760
process that screws up you didn't
 

5333
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,510
process that screws up you didn't
engineer it right and now the whole

5334
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
engineer it right and now the whole
 

5335
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,109
engineer it right and now the whole
company falls apart you can't make chips

5336
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:41,119
company falls apart you can't make chips
 

5337
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,109
company falls apart you can't make chips
right and so super super powerful

5338
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:43,119
right and so super super powerful
 

5339
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:45,070
right and so super super powerful
companies like Intel they had like the

5340
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:45,080
companies like Intel they had like the
 

5341
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,750
companies like Intel they had like the
weathering storm to like hey they still

5342
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:46,760
weathering storm to like hey they still
 

5343
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,270
weathering storm to like hey they still
exist today even though they really

5344
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:48,280
exist today even though they really
 

5345
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,189
exist today even though they really
screwed up their manufacturing six seven

5346
01:36:50,189 --> 01:36:50,199
screwed up their manufacturing six seven
 

5347
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:52,229
screwed up their manufacturing six seven
years ago but in the case of like AMD

5348
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:52,239
years ago but in the case of like AMD
 

5349
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:53,709
years ago but in the case of like AMD
they almost went bankrupt they had to s

5350
01:36:53,709 --> 01:36:53,719
they almost went bankrupt they had to s
 

5351
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:57,629
they almost went bankrupt they had to s
their Fabs to mubadala uh UAE right um

5352
01:36:57,629 --> 01:36:57,639
their Fabs to mubadala uh UAE right um
 

5353
01:36:57,639 --> 01:36:58,910
their Fabs to mubadala uh UAE right um
and and like that became a separate

5354
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:58,920
and and like that became a separate
 

5355
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,350
and and like that became a separate
company called Global foundaries which

5356
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:00,360
company called Global foundaries which
 

5357
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,709
company called Global foundaries which
is a Foundry firm um and and then AMD

5358
01:37:02,709 --> 01:37:02,719
is a Foundry firm um and and then AMD
 

5359
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,390
is a Foundry firm um and and then AMD
was able to then focus on like on the

5360
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:04,400
was able to then focus on like on the
 

5361
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,910
was able to then focus on like on the
return back up was like hey let's focus

5362
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:05,920
return back up was like hey let's focus
 

5363
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,990
return back up was like hey let's focus
on making chiplets and a bunch of

5364
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:08,000
on making chiplets and a bunch of
 

5365
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,189
on making chiplets and a bunch of
different chips for different markets um

5366
01:37:10,189 --> 01:37:10,199
different chips for different markets um
 

5367
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:12,030
different chips for different markets um
and focusing on specific workloads

5368
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:12,040
and focusing on specific workloads
 

5369
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,910
and focusing on specific workloads
rather than you know all of the these

5370
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:13,920
rather than you know all of the these
 

5371
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,270
rather than you know all of the these
different things and so you get more

5372
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:15,280
different things and so you get more
 

5373
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,390
different things and so you get more
diversity of chips you have more

5374
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,400
diversity of chips you have more
 

5375
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,550
diversity of chips you have more
companies than ever designing chips but

5376
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
companies than ever designing chips but
 

5377
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,270
companies than ever designing chips but
you have fewer companies than ever

5378
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:20,280
you have fewer companies than ever
 

5379
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,270
you have fewer companies than ever
manufacturing them right and this is

5380
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:22,280
manufacturing them right and this is
 

5381
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,350
manufacturing them right and this is
this is where tsmc comes in is they've

this is where tsmc comes in is they've
 

5383
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,149
this is where tsmc comes in is they've
they've just been the best right they

they've just been the best right they
 

5385
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:28,470
they've just been the best right they
are so good at it right they're customer

are so good at it right they're customer
 

5387
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,189
are so good at it right they're customer
focused they make it easy for you to

5388
01:37:30,189 --> 01:37:30,199
focused they make it easy for you to
 

5389
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:31,629
focused they make it easy for you to
fabricate your chips they take all of

5390
01:37:31,629 --> 01:37:31,639
fabricate your chips they take all of
 

5391
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:33,390
fabricate your chips they take all of
that complexity and like kind of try and

5392
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:33,400
that complexity and like kind of try and
 

5393
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,189
that complexity and like kind of try and
Abstract a lot of it away from you um

5394
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:35,199
Abstract a lot of it away from you um
 

5395
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:36,590
Abstract a lot of it away from you um
they make good money they don't make

5396
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:36,600
they make good money they don't make
 

5397
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,189
they make good money they don't make
insane money but they make good money um

5398
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:39,199
insane money but they make good money um
 

5399
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:41,229
insane money but they make good money um
and and they're able to aggregate all

5400
01:37:41,229 --> 01:37:41,239
and and they're able to aggregate all
 

5401
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:42,589
and and they're able to aggregate all
this demand and continue to build the

5402
01:37:42,589 --> 01:37:42,599
this demand and continue to build the
 

5403
01:37:42,599 --> 01:37:44,350
this demand and continue to build the
next Fab the next Fab the next Fab so

next Fab the next Fab the next Fab so
 

5405
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,109
next Fab the next Fab the next Fab so
why is Taiwan so special for tsmc why is

5406
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:47,119
why is Taiwan so special for tsmc why is
 

5407
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,990
why is Taiwan so special for tsmc why is
it happening there can it be replicated

5408
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,000
it happening there can it be replicated
 

5409
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,310
it happening there can it be replicated
inside the United States yeah so there's

5410
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
inside the United States yeah so there's
 

5411
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,870
inside the United States yeah so there's
there's aspects of it that I would say

5412
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:53,880
there's aspects of it that I would say
 

5413
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,669
there's aspects of it that I would say
yes and aspects that I'd say no right um

5414
01:37:56,669 --> 01:37:56,679
yes and aspects that I'd say no right um
 

5415
01:37:56,679 --> 01:38:00,510
yes and aspects that I'd say no right um
tsmc is way ahead because uh former you

5416
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:00,520
tsmc is way ahead because uh former you
 

5417

Instruments uh wasn't promoted to CEO

5420
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:04,920
Instruments uh wasn't promoted to CEO
 

5421
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,030
Instruments uh wasn't promoted to CEO
and he's like screw this I'm going to go

5422
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:06,040

5423
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,910
and he's like screw this I'm going to go
make a my own chip company right and he

5424
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
make a my own chip company right and he
 

5425
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,629
make a my own chip company right and he
went to Taiwan and made tsmc right and

5426
01:38:09,629 --> 01:38:09,639
went to Taiwan and made tsmc right and
 

5427
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:10,950
went to Taiwan and made tsmc right and
there's there's a whole lot more story

right instead of you know Texas
 

5439
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,350
right instead of you know Texas
Instruments right but but you know so

5440
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:20,360
Instruments right but but you know so
 

5441
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,149
Instruments right but but you know so
there is that whole story there but the

5442
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:22,159
there is that whole story there but the
 

5443
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:24,109
there is that whole story there but the
sitting here in Texas I mean and that

5444
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:24,119
sitting here in Texas I mean and that
 

5445
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:25,750

Morris changen you know which I wouldn't

5450
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,040
Morris changen you know which I wouldn't
 

5451
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,910
Morris changen you know which I wouldn't
underplay but there's also like a

underplay but there's also like a
 

5453
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,270
underplay but there's also like a
different level of like how how this

5454
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:33,280
different level of like how how this
 

5455
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,669
different level of like how how this
works right so in

5456
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
works right so in
 

5457
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,030
works right so in
Taiwan the you know like the number top

5458
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
Taiwan the you know like the number top
 

5459
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,510
Taiwan the you know like the number top
percent of graduates of students that go

5460
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
percent of graduates of students that go
 

5461
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,589
percent of graduates of students that go
to the best school which is n the top

5462
01:38:43,589 --> 01:38:43,599
to the best school which is n the top
 

5463
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:45,709
to the best school which is n the top
percent of those all go work to tsmc

5464
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:45,719
percent of those all go work to tsmc
 

5465
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:47,470
percent of those all go work to tsmc
right and and guess what their pay is

5466
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:47,480
right and and guess what their pay is
 

5467
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,910
right and and guess what their pay is
their starting pay is like $80,000

5468
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:49,920
their starting pay is like $80,000
 

5469
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,310
their starting pay is like $80,000
$70,000 right which is like that's like

5470
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
$70,000 right which is like that's like
 

5471
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,990
$70,000 right which is like that's like
starting pay for like a good graduate in

5472
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:54,000
starting pay for like a good graduate in
 

5473
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,629
starting pay for like a good graduate in
the US right not not the top the top

5474
01:38:55,629 --> 01:38:55,639
the US right not not the top the top
 

5475
01:38:55,639 --> 01:38:57,070
the US right not not the top the top
graduates are making hundreds of

5476
01:38:57,070 --> 01:38:57,080
graduates are making hundreds of
 

5477
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,310
graduates are making hundreds of
thousands of dollars at the Googles and

5478
01:38:59,310 --> 01:38:59,320
thousands of dollars at the Googles and
 

5479
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,070
thousands of dollars at the Googles and
the Amazon and now I guess the open AI

5480
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:01,080
the Amazon and now I guess the open AI
 

5481
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,390
the Amazon and now I guess the open AI
of the world right um so so there is

5482
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:03,400
of the world right um so so there is
 

5483
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,149
of the world right um so so there is
there is a large dichotomy of like what

5484
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:05,159
there is a large dichotomy of like what
 

5485
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:07,550
there is a large dichotomy of like what
is the top 1% of the society doing and

5486
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:07,560
is the top 1% of the society doing and
 

5487
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,589
is the top 1% of the society doing and
where are they headed because of

5488
01:39:08,589 --> 01:39:08,599
where are they headed because of
 

5489
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:10,310
where are they headed because of
economic reasons right Intel never paid

5490
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,320
economic reasons right Intel never paid
 

5491
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,310
economic reasons right Intel never paid
that crazy good right um and and it

5492
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,320
that crazy good right um and and it
 

5493
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,910
that crazy good right um and and it
didn't make sense to them right that's

5494
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,920
didn't make sense to them right that's
 

5495
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,390
didn't make sense to them right that's
that's one aspect right where is the

5496
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:15,400
that's one aspect right where is the
 

5497
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,189
that's one aspect right where is the
best going second is the work ethic

5498
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:17,199
best going second is the work ethic
 

5499
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,510
best going second is the work ethic
right like you know we we like to work

5500
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:19,520
right like you know we we like to work
 

5501
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,589
right like you know we we like to work
you know you work a lot we work a lot

5502
01:39:21,589 --> 01:39:21,599
you know you work a lot we work a lot
 

5503
01:39:21,599 --> 01:39:23,790
you know you work a lot we work a lot
but at the end of the day um when

5504
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:23,800
but at the end of the day um when
 

5505
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,589
but at the end of the day um when
there's a you know when when what what

5506
01:39:25,589 --> 01:39:25,599
there's a you know when when what what
 

5507
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:26,990
there's a you know when when what what
is the time and amount of work that

5508
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:27,000
is the time and amount of work that
 

5509
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,629
is the time and amount of work that
you're doing and what does a Fab require

5510
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:28,639
you're doing and what does a Fab require
 

5511
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:30,550
you're doing and what does a Fab require
right Fabs are not work from home jobs

5512
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:30,560
right Fabs are not work from home jobs
 

5513
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,910
right Fabs are not work from home jobs
they are you go into the Fab and

5514
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
they are you go into the Fab and
 

5515
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,550
they are you go into the Fab and
grueling work right um there's there's

5516
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:35,560
grueling work right um there's there's
 

5517
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,830
grueling work right um there's there's
hey if there is any amount of vibration

5518
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:37,840
hey if there is any amount of vibration
 

5519
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,109
hey if there is any amount of vibration
right an earthquake happens vibrates the

5520
01:39:40,109 --> 01:39:40,119
right an earthquake happens vibrates the
 

5521
01:39:40,119 --> 01:39:41,950
right an earthquake happens vibrates the
machines they're all you know they're

5522
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:41,960
machines they're all you know they're
 

5523
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,709
machines they're all you know they're
either broken you've Lo you've scrapped

5524
01:39:43,709 --> 01:39:43,719
either broken you've Lo you've scrapped
 

5525
01:39:43,719 --> 01:39:45,229
either broken you've Lo you've scrapped
some of your production and then in many

5526
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:45,239
some of your production and then in many
 

5527
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:46,750
some of your production and then in many
cases they're like not calibrated

5528
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:46,760
cases they're like not calibrated
 

5529
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,229
cases they're like not calibrated
properly so so when tsmc when there's an

5530
01:39:49,229 --> 01:39:49,239
properly so so when tsmc when there's an
 

5531
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:50,550
properly so so when tsmc when there's an
earthquake right recently there's been

5532
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:50,560
earthquake right recently there's been
 

5533
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,629
earthquake right recently there's been
an earthquake tsmc doesn't call their

5534
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
an earthquake tsmc doesn't call their
 

5535
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:55,070
an earthquake tsmc doesn't call their
employees they just they just go to the

5536
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,080
employees they just they just go to the
 

5537
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,830
employees they just they just go to the
Fab and like they just show up the

5538
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:56,840
Fab and like they just show up the
 

5539
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,790
Fab and like they just show up the
parking lot gets slammed and people just

5540
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
parking lot gets slammed and people just
 

5541
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,990
parking lot gets slammed and people just
go into the Fab and fix it right like

5542
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:01,000
go into the Fab and fix it right like
 

5543
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,629
go into the Fab and fix it right like
it's like an arm it's like ants right

euv they're investing in this and then
 

5851
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,310
euv they're investing in this and then
they have large supply for things like

5852
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:17,320
they have large supply for things like
 

5853
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,870
they have large supply for things like
the car door handles and the random

whole ecomic discussion as well which is
 

5859
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,830
whole ecomic discussion as well which is
they have far more than we do and having

to normal life so they're doing the

5864
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:30,440
to normal life so they're doing the
 

5865
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,870
to normal life so they're doing the
they're starting to invest in high

5866
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:31,880
they're starting to invest in high
 

5867
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,510
they're starting to invest in high
volume manufacturer but they're not

5868
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:33,520
volume manufacturer but they're not
 

5869
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,310
volume manufacturer but they're not
doing R&D so they they do R&D on their

5870
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
doing R&D so they they do R&D on their
 

5871
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,149
doing R&D so they they do R&D on their
own they're just way behind right um so

5872
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
own they're just way behind right um so
 

5873
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:41,629

2025 uh in 2020 certain goals including
like 80% domestic production of

5880
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:49,280
like 80% domestic production of
 

5881
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,790
like 80% domestic production of
semiconductors uh they're not they're

5882
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:50,800
semiconductors uh they're not they're
 

5883
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,270
semiconductors uh they're not they're
not going to hit that right to be clear

5884
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:52,280
not going to hit that right to be clear
 

5885
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,270
not going to hit that right to be clear
but they are there are in certain areas

5886
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:54,280
but they are there are in certain areas
 

5887
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:57,270
but they are there are in certain areas
really really close right like byd is

5888
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
really really close right like byd is
 

5889
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,550
really really close right like byd is
probably going to be the first company

5890
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
probably going to be the first company
 

5891
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,310
probably going to be the first company
in the world to not have to use tsmc for

5892
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:01,320
in the world to not have to use tsmc for
 

5893

right uh for making chips now they still

5896
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:05,000
right uh for making chips now they still
 

5897
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,109
right uh for making chips now they still
have to buy some chips from foreign uh

5898
01:46:07,109 --> 01:46:07,119
have to buy some chips from foreign uh
 

5899
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:09,149
have to buy some chips from foreign uh
for example like around like

um and this is this is something that
 

5923
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,390

that's happened you know is yes they've

5940
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:47,560
that's happened you know is yes they've
 

5941
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:50,270
that's happened you know is yes they've
slowed down their 5 neter 3 nmet Etc but

5942
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:50,280
slowed down their 5 neter 3 nmet Etc but
 

5943
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,470
slowed down their 5 neter 3 nmet Etc but
they've accelerated their hey 45 n 90

kind of stuff so so there is an angle of

5950
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:01,280
kind of stuff so so there is an angle of
 

5951
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,870
kind of stuff so so there is an angle of
like the US's actions have been so from

01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:03,880
like the US's actions have been so from

these export you know from the angle of
 

5955
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:08,070
these export you know from the angle of
the export controls have been so

5956
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:08,080
the export controls have been so

inflammatory at slowing down China's

5958
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:10,280
inflammatory at slowing down China's
 

5959
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,830

progress on the Leading Edge that

5960
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
progress on the Leading Edge that
 

5961
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,030
progress on the Leading Edge that
they've turned around and have

5962
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,040
they've turned around and have
 

5963
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,669
they've turned around and have
accelerated their progress elsewhere

5964
01:47:14,669 --> 01:47:14,679
accelerated their progress elsewhere
 

5965
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:16,270
accelerated their progress elsewhere
because they know they this is so

5966
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:16,280
because they know they this is so
 

5967
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,390
because they know they this is so
important right if the us is going to

5968
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:17,400
important right if the us is going to
 

5969
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,830
important right if the us is going to
lock them out here what if they lock us

5970
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:18,840
lock them out here what if they lock us
 

5971
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,709
lock them out here what if they lock us
out here as well uh in the trailing Edge

5972
01:47:20,709 --> 01:47:20,719
out here as well uh in the trailing Edge
 

5973
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:22,950
out here as well uh in the trailing Edge
and so going back can the US build it

5974
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:22,960
and so going back can the US build it
 

5975
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,070
and so going back can the US build it
here um yes but it's going to take a ton

5976
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,080
here um yes but it's going to take a ton
 

5977
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,430
here um yes but it's going to take a ton
of money I truly think like to to

5978
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,440
of money I truly think like to to
 

5979
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:30,350
of money I truly think like to to
revolutionize and completely insource

5980
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:30,360
revolutionize and completely insource
 

5981
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,229
revolutionize and completely insource
semiconductors would take a decade and a

5982
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
semiconductors would take a decade and a
 

5983
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,109
semiconductors would take a decade and a
trillion dollars is some of it also

5984
01:47:34,109 --> 01:47:34,119
trillion dollars is some of it also
 

5985
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:36,669
trillion dollars is some of it also
culture like you said extreme competence

5986
01:47:36,669 --> 01:47:36,679
culture like you said extreme competence
 

5987
01:47:36,679 --> 01:47:39,310
culture like you said extreme competence
extreme work ethic in Taiwan I think if

5988
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:39,320
extreme work ethic in Taiwan I think if
 

5989
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,070
extreme work ethic in Taiwan I think if
you have the demand and the money is on

5990
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:41,080
you have the demand and the money is on
 

5991
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,830
you have the demand and the money is on
the line the American companies figure

5992
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:42,840
the line the American companies figure
 

5993
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,310
the line the American companies figure
it out it's going to take handholding

5994
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:44,320
it out it's going to take handholding
 

5995
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,149
it out it's going to take handholding
with the government but I I think that

5996
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:46,159
with the government but I I think that
 

5997
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:49,070
with the government but I I think that
the culture helps tsmc break through and

5998
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:49,080
the culture helps tsmc break through and
 

5999
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,070
the culture helps tsmc break through and
it's easier for them you you tsmc has

6000
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:51,080
it's easier for them you you tsmc has
 

6001
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,550
it's easier for them you you tsmc has
something like 990,000 employees right

6002
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
something like 990,000 employees right
 

6003
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,070
something like 990,000 employees right
it's not actually that insane amount um

6004
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:55,080
it's not actually that insane amount um
 

6005
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,109
it's not actually that insane amount um
the Arizona Fab has 3,000 from Taiwan

6006
01:47:58,109 --> 01:47:58,119
the Arizona Fab has 3,000 from Taiwan
 

6007
01:47:58,119 --> 01:47:59,669

and and these people like their wives

6008
01:47:59,669 --> 01:47:59,679
and and these people like their wives
 

6009
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:00,709
and and these people like their wives
were like yeah we're not going to have

6010
01:48:00,709 --> 01:48:00,719
were like yeah we're not going to have
 

6011
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,470
were like yeah we're not going to have
kids unless we you sign up for the

6012
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:02,480
kids unless we you sign up for the
 

6013
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,149
kids unless we you sign up for the
Arizona Fab we go to Arizona and we have

6014
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
Arizona Fab we go to Arizona and we have
 

6015
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:05,830
Arizona Fab we go to Arizona and we have
our kids there there's also a Japan Fab

6016
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:05,840
our kids there there's also a Japan Fab
 

6017
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:06,950
our kids there there's also a Japan Fab
where the same thing happened right and

6018
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:06,960
where the same thing happened right and
 

6019
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,270
where the same thing happened right and
so like these wives drove like these

6020
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,280
so like these wives drove like these
 

6021
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,510
so like these wives drove like these
like these dudes to like go to Japan or

6022
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
like these dudes to like go to Japan or
 

6023
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,310
like these dudes to like go to Japan or
America to have the kids there and it's

like the US has done it in the past they
 

6031
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,510
like the US has done it in the past they
could do it now right um you know we can

6032
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:21,520
could do it now right um you know we can
 

6033
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,510
could do it now right um you know we can
just import I say import the best people

6034
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:24,520
just import I say import the best people
 

6035
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,030
just import I say import the best people
in the world if we want to that's where

6036
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:26,040
in the world if we want to that's where
 

6037
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,950
in the world if we want to that's where
the immigration conversation is a tricky

6038
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:27,960
the immigration conversation is a tricky
 

6039
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,390
the immigration conversation is a tricky
one and there's been a lot of debate

6040
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:29,400
one and there's been a lot of debate
 

6041
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,310
one and there's been a lot of debate
over that but yeah it it seems absurdly

6042
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:32,320
over that but yeah it it seems absurdly
 

6043
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:33,830
over that but yeah it it seems absurdly
controversial to import the best people

6044
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:33,840
controversial to import the best people
 

6045
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,390
controversial to import the best people
in the world I don't understand why it's

6046
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:35,400
in the world I don't understand why it's
 

6047
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,350
in the world I don't understand why it's
controversial that's that's the one of

6048
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,360
controversial that's that's the one of
 

6049
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,229
controversial that's that's the one of
the ways of wi sure we agree with you

6050
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:39,239
the ways of wi sure we agree with you
 

6051
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:40,990
the ways of wi sure we agree with you
and and and like even if you can't

6052
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:41,000
and and and like even if you can't
 

6053
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,430
and and and like even if you can't
import those people I still think you

6054
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:42,440
import those people I still think you
 

6055
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,350
import those people I still think you
could do a lot to manufacture most of in

6056
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:44,360
could do a lot to manufacture most of in
 

6057
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,470
could do a lot to manufacture most of in
the US if the money's there right and so

6058
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:46,480
the US if the money's there right and so
 

6059
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,350
the US if the money's there right and so
like just way more expensive it's not

6060
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:48,360
like just way more expensive it's not
 

6061
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,149
like just way more expensive it's not
profitable for a long time and that's

6062
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:50,159
profitable for a long time and that's
 

6063
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,790
profitable for a long time and that's
the context of like the chips Act is

6064
01:48:51,790 --> 01:48:51,800
the context of like the chips Act is
 

6065
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,550
the context of like the chips Act is
only like $50 billion

6066
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:53,560
only like $50 billion
 

6067
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,270
only like $50 billion
relative to you know some of the

6068
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,280
relative to you know some of the
 

6069
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,430
relative to you know some of the
renewable um you know initiatives that

6070
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:57,440
renewable um you know initiatives that
 

6071
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,910
renewable um you know initiatives that
were passed in the inflation reduction

6072
01:48:58,910 --> 01:48:58,920
were passed in the inflation reduction
 

6073
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,830
were passed in the inflation reduction
Act and the infrastructure act which

6074
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:00,840
Act and the infrastructure act which
 

6075
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,430
Act and the infrastructure act which
total in the hundreds of billions of

6076
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:02,440
total in the hundreds of billions of
 

6077
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:03,790
total in the hundreds of billions of
dollars right and so like the amount of

6078
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:03,800
dollars right and so like the amount of
 

6079
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,109
dollars right and so like the amount of
money that the US is spending on the

6080
01:49:05,109 --> 01:49:05,119
money that the US is spending on the
 

6081
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,629
money that the US is spending on the
semiconductor industry is is nothing

6082
01:49:07,629 --> 01:49:07,639
semiconductor industry is is nothing
 

6083
01:49:07,639 --> 01:49:09,430
semiconductor industry is is nothing
right um whereas all these other

6084
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:09,440
right um whereas all these other
 

6085
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,350
right um whereas all these other
countries have uh structural advantages

6086
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
countries have uh structural advantages
 

6087
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,070
countries have uh structural advantages
in terms of like you know work ethic and

6088
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:13,080
in terms of like you know work ethic and
 

6089
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,750
in terms of like you know work ethic and
amount of work and like things like that

6090
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:14,760
amount of work and like things like that
 

6091
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,990
amount of work and like things like that
but also a number of stem graduates the

6092
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:17,000
but also a number of stem graduates the
 

6093
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,870
but also a number of stem graduates the
the percentile of their best going to

6094
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:18,880
the percentile of their best going to
 

6095
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,109
the percentile of their best going to
that right um but they also have like

6096
01:49:21,109 --> 01:49:21,119
that right um but they also have like
 

6097
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,350
that right um but they also have like
differences in terms of like hey there's

6098
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:23,360
differences in terms of like hey there's
 

6099
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,830
differences in terms of like hey there's
just tax benefits in the law and have

6100
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:25,840
just tax benefits in the law and have
 

6101
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,709
just tax benefits in the law and have
been in the law for 20 years right um

6102
01:49:27,709 --> 01:49:27,719
been in the law for 20 years right um
 

6103
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:29,229
been in the law for 20 years right um
and so and then and then some countries

6104
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:29,239
and so and then and then some countries
 

6105
01:49:29,239 --> 01:49:31,910
and so and then and then some countries
have massive subsidies right China has

6106
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:31,920
have massive subsidies right China has
 

6107
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,589
have massive subsidies right China has
something like $200 billion of

6108
01:49:33,589 --> 01:49:33,599
something like $200 billion of
 

6109
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,350
something like $200 billion of
semiconductor subsidies a year we're

6110
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
semiconductor subsidies a year we're
 

6111
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,550
semiconductor subsidies a year we're
talking about $50 billion in the US over

6112
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:37,560
talking about $50 billion in the US over
 

6113
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:40,030
talking about $50 billion in the US over
like six right so the the the the the

6114
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:40,040
like six right so the the the the the
 

6115
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,950
like six right so the the the the the
the girth or difference in like the

6116
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:41,960
the girth or difference in like the
 

6117
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,189
the girth or difference in like the
subsidy Amounts is also huge right and

6118
01:49:44,189 --> 01:49:44,199
subsidy Amounts is also huge right and
 

6119
01:49:44,199 --> 01:49:45,950
subsidy Amounts is also huge right and
and so I think um you know Trump has

6120
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:45,960
and so I think um you know Trump has
 

6121
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,669
and so I think um you know Trump has
been talking about terrifing Taiwan

6122
01:49:47,669 --> 01:49:47,679
been talking about terrifing Taiwan
 

6123
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:50,430
been talking about terrifing Taiwan
recently um you know that's sort of like

6124
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:50,440
recently um you know that's sort of like
 

6125
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:52,149
recently um you know that's sort of like
one of these things that's like oh okay

6126
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
one of these things that's like oh okay
 

6127
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,629
one of these things that's like oh okay
well like you know maybe he doesn't want

6128
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:53,639
well like you know maybe he doesn't want
 

6129
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:55,109
well like you know maybe he doesn't want
to subsidize the US semiconductor

6130
01:49:55,109 --> 01:49:55,119
to subsidize the US semiconductor
 

6131
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:57,149
to subsidize the US semiconductor
industry obviously tariffing Taiwan is

6132
01:49:57,149 --> 01:49:57,159
industry obviously tariffing Taiwan is
 

6133
01:49:57,159 --> 01:49:59,109
industry obviously tariffing Taiwan is
going to cost a lot of things to go get

6134
01:49:59,109 --> 01:49:59,119
going to cost a lot of things to go get
 

6135
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:00,870
going to cost a lot of things to go get
much more expensive but does it change

6136
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
much more expensive but does it change
 

6137
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,589
much more expensive but does it change
the equation for tsmc building more Fabs

6138
01:50:02,589 --> 01:50:02,599
the equation for tsmc building more Fabs
 

6139
01:50:02,599 --> 01:50:04,109
the equation for tsmc building more Fabs
in the US that's what he's sort of

6140
01:50:04,109 --> 01:50:04,119
in the US that's what he's sort of
 

6141
01:50:04,119 --> 01:50:07,510
in the US that's what he's sort of
positing right so can you lay out the so

6142
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,520
positing right so can you lay out the so
 

6143
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,709
positing right so can you lay out the so
we laid out the importance by the way

6144
01:50:09,709 --> 01:50:09,719
we laid out the importance by the way
 

6145
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:11,870
we laid out the importance by the way
it's incredible how much you know about

6146
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:11,880
it's incredible how much you know about
 

6147
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,990
it's incredible how much you know about
so much we told you Dylan knows all the

6148
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:15,000
so much we told you Dylan knows all the
 

6149
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,270
so much we told you Dylan knows all the
stuff yeah so but okay you laid out why

6150
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:19,280
stuff yeah so but okay you laid out why
 

6151
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,950
stuff yeah so but okay you laid out why
tsmc is really important if we look out

6152
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:21,960
tsmc is really important if we look out
 

6153
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,470
tsmc is really important if we look out
into the future 10 20 years

6154
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:24,480
into the future 10 20 years

01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
out us China relationship seems like it
 

6157
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,990

can go to a dark

6158
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:31,000
can go to a dark
 

6159
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,669
can go to a dark
place of Cold War escalated cold war or

6160
01:50:35,669 --> 01:50:35,679
place of Cold War escalated cold war or
 

6161
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:39,550

game uh what are the different

6170
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
game uh what are the different
 

6171
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,030
game uh what are the different
trajectories what should us be doing

6172
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:53,040
trajectories what should us be doing
 

6173
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,270
trajectories what should us be doing
like what do you see as the different

6174
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:54,280
like what do you see as the different
 

6175
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,830
like what do you see as the different
possible trajectories of us China

6176
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:55,840
possible trajectories of us China
 

6177
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,750

relations as uh both leaders start to

6178
01:50:58,750 --> 01:50:58,760
relations as uh both leaders start to
 

6179
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:01,069
relations as uh both leaders start to
feel the AGI more and more and see the

6180
01:51:01,069 --> 01:51:01,079
feel the AGI more and more and see the
 

6181
01:51:01,079 --> 01:51:03,109
feel the AGI more and more and see the
importance of chips and the importance

6182
01:51:03,109 --> 01:51:03,119
importance of chips and the importance
 

6183
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:06,390
importance of chips and the importance
of AI I mean ultimately the export

6184
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:06,400

01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:45,520
maintain its top position and what China
 

6341
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,030
maintain its top position and what China
is trying to do is become the top

6342
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:47,040
is trying to do is become the top
 

6343
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,629
is trying to do is become the top
position right and and obviously there

6344
01:53:49,629 --> 01:53:49,639
position right and and obviously there
 

6345
01:53:49,639 --> 01:53:51,750
position right and and obviously there
there's budding of heads here um in in

6346
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:51,760
there's budding of heads here um in in
 

6347
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,669
there's budding of heads here um in in
in the most simple terms and that could

6348
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679
in the most simple terms and that could
 

6349
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,750
in the most simple terms and that could
take shape in all kinds of ways

6350
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:55,760
take shape in all kinds of ways
 

6351
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,310
take shape in all kinds of ways
including proxy

6352
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:57,320
including proxy
 

6353
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,790
including proxy
wars seems like it's already happening

6354
01:53:59,790 --> 01:53:59,800
wars seems like it's already happening
 

6355
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:02,229
wars seems like it's already happening
like as much as I want there to be

6356
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
like as much as I want there to be
 

6357
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,629
like as much as I want there to be
centuries of prolonged peace it does not

6358
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
centuries of prolonged peace it does not
 

6359
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:07,069
centuries of prolonged peace it does not
it looks like further instability

6360
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:07,079
it looks like further instability
 

6361
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:09,430
it looks like further instability
internationally is ahead and and and the

6362
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
internationally is ahead and and and the
 

6363
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,790
internationally is ahead and and and the
US's like sort of like current task is

6364
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:11,800
US's like sort of like current task is
 

6365
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:14,109
US's like sort of like current task is
like hey if we control AI if we're the

6366
01:54:14,109 --> 01:54:14,119
like hey if we control AI if we're the
 

6367
01:54:14,119 --> 01:54:16,870
like hey if we control AI if we're the
leader in AI then we and we and AI could

6368
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:16,880
leader in AI then we and we and AI could
 

6369
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,910
leader in AI then we and we and AI could
significantly accelerates progress then

6370
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:18,920
significantly accelerates progress then
 

6371
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,390
significantly accelerates progress then
we can maintain the global hemony

6372
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:20,400
we can maintain the global hemony
 

6373
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,069
we can maintain the global hemony
position and therefore I I hope that

6374
01:54:22,069 --> 01:54:22,079
position and therefore I I hope that
 

6375
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:24,510
position and therefore I I hope that
works and and and as an American like

6376
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:24,520
works and and and as an American like
 

6377
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:25,709
works and and and as an American like
you know kind of like okay I guess

6378
01:54:25,709 --> 01:54:25,719
you know kind of like okay I guess
 

6379
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:27,310
you know kind of like okay I guess
that's going to lead to peace peace for

6380
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:27,320
that's going to lead to peace peace for
 

6381
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,229
that's going to lead to peace peace for
us uh now obviously other people around

6382
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:29,239
us uh now obviously other people around
 

6383
01:54:29,239 --> 01:54:32,550
us uh now obviously other people around
the world get affected negatively um you

6384
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
the world get affected negatively um you
 

6385
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,030
the world get affected negatively um you
know obviously the Chinese people are

6386
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:34,040
know obviously the Chinese people are
 

6387
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:35,790
know obviously the Chinese people are
not going to be in as advantageous of a

6388
01:54:35,790 --> 01:54:35,800
not going to be in as advantageous of a
 

6389
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:39,229
not going to be in as advantageous of a
position um if that happens but uh you

6390
01:54:39,229 --> 01:54:39,239
position um if that happens but uh you
 

6391
01:54:39,239 --> 01:54:41,550
position um if that happens but uh you
know this is sort of the reality of like

6392
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:41,560
know this is sort of the reality of like
 

6393
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,830
know this is sort of the reality of like
what's being done and the actions that

6394
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:42,840
what's being done and the actions that
 

6395
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,069
what's being done and the actions that
are being carried out so can we go back

6396
01:54:45,069 --> 01:54:45,079
are being carried out so can we go back
 

6397
01:54:45,079 --> 01:54:47,189
are being carried out so can we go back
to the specific detail of the different

Hardware there's this nice graphic in

6400
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:49,400
Hardware there's this nice graphic in
 

6401
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,629
Hardware there's this nice graphic in
the export

6402
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:50,639
the export
 

6403
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:54,350
the export
controls uh of which

6404
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:54,360

 

6405
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:57,430

uh which gpus are allowed to be exported

6406
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:57,440
uh which gpus are allowed to be exported
 

6407
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,390
uh which gpus are allowed to be exported
and which are not can you kind of

6408
01:54:59,390 --> 01:54:59,400
and which are not can you kind of
 

6409
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:02,350
and which are not can you kind of
explain the difference like is there um

6410
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:02,360
explain the difference like is there um
 

6411
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:05,709
explain the difference like is there um
from a technical perspective are the

6412
01:55:05,709 --> 01:55:05,719
from a technical perspective are the
 

6413
01:55:05,719 --> 01:55:07,430

promising yeah so this goes uh and I

6416
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:10,000
promising yeah so this goes uh and I
 

6417
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,589
promising yeah so this goes uh and I
think we'd have to like we need to dive

6418
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:11,599
think we'd have to like we need to dive
 

6419
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:13,229
think we'd have to like we need to dive
really deep into the reasoning aspect

6420
01:55:13,229 --> 01:55:13,239
really deep into the reasoning aspect
 

6421
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:15,990
really deep into the reasoning aspect
and what's going on there but the H20

6422
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:16,000
and what's going on there but the H20
 

6423
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,550
and what's going on there but the H20
you know the US has gone through

6424
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:17,560
you know the US has gone through

point allowed uh back in 23 but then it

6430
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:24,040
point allowed uh back in 23 but then it
 

6431
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,189
point allowed uh back in 23 but then it
got canceled and by then by uh you know

6432
01:55:26,189 --> 01:55:26,199
got canceled and by then by uh you know

01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,310
deeps had already built their cluster of
they claimed 2K I think they actually

6436
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:29,320
they claimed 2K I think they actually
 

6437
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,589
they claimed 2K I think they actually
have like many more like something like

6438
01:55:30,589 --> 01:55:30,599
have like many more like something like
 

6439
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:33,149
have like many more like something like
10k of those um and now this H20 is the

6440
01:55:33,149 --> 01:55:33,159
10k of those um and now this H20 is the
 

6441
01:55:33,159 --> 01:55:34,830
10k of those um and now this H20 is the
legally allowed chip right Nvidia

6442
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:34,840
legally allowed chip right Nvidia
 

6443
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:36,390
legally allowed chip right Nvidia
shipped a million of these last year to

6444
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:36,400
shipped a million of these last year to
 

6445
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,470
shipped a million of these last year to
China right for context was like five

6446
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:38,480
China right for context was like five
 

6447
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,310
China right for context was like five
four or five million gpus right so the

6448
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,320
four or five million gpus right so the
 

6449
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,589
four or five million gpus right so the
percentage of gpus that were this China

6450
01:55:42,589 --> 01:55:42,599
percentage of gpus that were this China
 

6451
01:55:42,599 --> 01:55:45,910
percentage of gpus that were this China
specific H20 is quite high right um you

6452
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:45,920
specific H20 is quite high right um you
 

6453
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:49,069
specific H20 is quite high right um you
know roughly 20% 25% right 20% or so um

6454
01:55:49,069 --> 01:55:49,079
know roughly 20% 25% right 20% or so um
 

6455
01:55:49,079 --> 01:55:52,589
know roughly 20% 25% right 20% or so um
and so this H20 has been neutered in one

6456
01:55:52,589 --> 01:55:52,599
and so this H20 has been neutered in one
 

6457
01:55:52,599 --> 01:55:54,430
and so this H20 has been neutered in one
way but it's actually upgraded in other

6458
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:54,440
way but it's actually upgraded in other
 

6459
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,470
way but it's actually upgraded in other
ways right and you know you could think

6460
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:56,480
ways right and you know you could think
 

6461
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,390
ways right and you know you could think
of chips along three axes for AI right

6462
01:55:59,390 --> 01:55:59,400
of chips along three axes for AI right
 

6463
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,270
of chips along three axes for AI right
um you know ignoring ignoring software

6464
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:01,280
um you know ignoring ignoring software
 

6465
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,030
um you know ignoring ignoring software
stack and like exact architecture just

6466
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:03,040
stack and like exact architecture just
 

6467
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,830
stack and like exact architecture just
raw specifications there's floating

6468
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:04,840
raw specifications there's floating
 

6469
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,270
raw specifications there's floating
Point operations right flops there is

6470
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
Point operations right flops there is
 

6471
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,390
Point operations right flops there is
memory bandwidth um IE and memory

6472
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:09,400
memory bandwidth um IE and memory
 

6473
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:11,750
memory bandwidth um IE and memory
capacity right uh IO right memory and

6474
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:11,760
capacity right uh IO right memory and
 

6475
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,550
capacity right uh IO right memory and
then there is interconnect right chipto

6476
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:13,560
then there is interconnect right chipto
 

6477
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,069
then there is interconnect right chipto
chip interconnections all three of these

6478
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:16,079
chip interconnections all three of these
 

6479
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:20,629
chip interconnections all three of these
are incredibly important for making AI

6480
01:56:20,629 --> 01:56:20,639
are incredibly important for making AI
 

6481
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,510
are incredibly important for making AI
systems right because AI systems invol a

6482
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:22,520
systems right because AI systems invol a
 

6483
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,030
systems right because AI systems invol a
lot of compute they involve a lot of

6484
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:24,040
lot of compute they involve a lot of
 

6485
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:26,189
lot of compute they involve a lot of
moving memory around uh whether it be to

6486
01:56:26,189 --> 01:56:26,199
moving memory around uh whether it be to
 

6487
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:28,790
moving memory around uh whether it be to
memory or two other chips right and so

6488
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
memory or two other chips right and so
 

6489
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,310
memory or two other chips right and so
these three vectors um the US initially

6490
01:56:31,310 --> 01:56:31,320
these three vectors um the US initially
 

6491
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,750
these three vectors um the US initially
had a multi you know had two of these

6492
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:32,760
had a multi you know had two of these
 

6493
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,229
had a multi you know had two of these
vectors controlled and one of them not

6494
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:34,239
vectors controlled and one of them not
 

6495
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:35,750
vectors controlled and one of them not
controlled which was flops and

6496
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:35,760
controlled which was flops and
 

6497
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,030
controlled which was flops and
interconnect bandwidth were initially

6498
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,040
interconnect bandwidth were initially
 

6499
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,870
interconnect bandwidth were initially
controlled um and then they said no no

6500
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:38,880
controlled um and then they said no no
 

6501
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:39,589
controlled um and then they said no no
no no we're going to remove the

6502
01:56:39,589 --> 01:56:39,599
no no we're going to remove the
 

6503
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:40,750
no no we're going to remove the
interconnect bandwidth and just make it

6504
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:40,760
interconnect bandwidth and just make it
 

6505
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,750
interconnect bandwidth and just make it
a very simple only flops but now Nvidia

6506
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
a very simple only flops but now Nvidia
 

6507
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,790
a very simple only flops but now Nvidia
can now make a chip that has uh okay

6508
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:45,800
can now make a chip that has uh okay
 

6509
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,750
can now make a chip that has uh okay
it's cut down on flops not it's you know

6510
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:47,760
it's cut down on flops not it's you know
 

6511
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,430
it's cut down on flops not it's you know
it's like onethird that of the h100

6512
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:50,440
it's like onethird that of the h100
 

6513
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:53,270
it's like onethird that of the h100
right in in in uh on spec sheet paper

6514
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:53,280
right in in in uh on spec sheet paper
 

6515
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,189
right in in in uh on spec sheet paper
performance for flops um you know in

6516
01:56:55,189 --> 01:56:55,199
performance for flops um you know in
 

6517
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:57,149
performance for flops um you know in
real world it's closer to like half uh

6518
01:56:57,149 --> 01:56:57,159
real world it's closer to like half uh
 

6519
01:56:57,159 --> 01:56:59,790
real world it's closer to like half uh
or maybe even like 60% of it right but

6520
01:56:59,790 --> 01:56:59,800
or maybe even like 60% of it right but
 

6521
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,390
or maybe even like 60% of it right but
then on the other two vectors it's just

6522
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:01,400
then on the other two vectors it's just
 

6523
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,310
then on the other two vectors it's just
as good uh for interconnect bandwidth

6524
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:03,320
as good uh for interconnect bandwidth
 

6525
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:04,709
as good uh for interconnect bandwidth
and then for memory bandwidth and memory

6526
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
and then for memory bandwidth and memory
 

6527
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,790
and then for memory bandwidth and memory
capacity the H20 has more memory

6528
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:06,800
capacity the H20 has more memory
 

6529
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,430
capacity the H20 has more memory
bandwidth and more memory capacity than

6530
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
bandwidth and more memory capacity than
 

6531
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:12,870
bandwidth and more memory capacity than
the h100 right now recently you know we

6532
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:12,880
the h100 right now recently you know we
 

6533
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,629
the h100 right now recently you know we
we at our research we cut nvidia's

6534
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:14,639
we at our research we cut nvidia's
 

6535
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,510
we at our research we cut nvidia's
production for H20 for this year down

6536
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
production for H20 for this year down
 

6537
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,550
production for H20 for this year down
drastically they were going to make

6538
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:18,560
drastically they were going to make
 

6539
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,669
drastically they were going to make
another 2 million of those this year but

6540
01:57:20,669 --> 01:57:20,679
another 2 million of those this year but
 

6541
01:57:20,679 --> 01:57:22,350
another 2 million of those this year but
they just canel all the orders a couple

6542
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:22,360
they just canel all the orders a couple
 

6543
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,629
they just canel all the orders a couple
weeks ago um in our view that's because

6544
01:57:24,629 --> 01:57:24,639
weeks ago um in our view that's because
 

6545
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:25,550
weeks ago um in our view that's because
we think that they think they're going

6546
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:25,560
we think that they think they're going
 

6547
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,990
we think that they think they're going
to get restricted right um because why

6548
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:28,000
to get restricted right um because why
 

6549
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,470
to get restricted right um because why
would they cancel all these orders for

6550
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:29,480
would they cancel all these orders for
 

6551
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:31,750
would they cancel all these orders for
H20 um because they shipped a million of

6552
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:31,760
H20 um because they shipped a million of
 

6553
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,350
H20 um because they shipped a million of
them last year they had orders in for a

6554
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,360
them last year they had orders in for a
 

6555
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,270
them last year they had orders in for a
couple million this year and just gone

6556
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,280
couple million this year and just gone
 

6557
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,350
couple million this year and just gone
right for H20 B20 right a successor to

6558
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:37,360
right for H20 B20 right a successor to
 

6559
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,470
right for H20 B20 right a successor to
H20 um and now they're all gone now why

6560
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:39,480
H20 um and now they're all gone now why
 

6561
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:41,830
H20 um and now they're all gone now why
would they do this right um I think it's

6562
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840
would they do this right um I think it's
 

6563
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:44,470
would they do this right um I think it's
it's very clear right the the H20 is

6564
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:44,480
it's very clear right the the H20 is
 

6565
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,830
it's very clear right the the H20 is
actually better for certain tasks and

6566
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:46,840
actually better for certain tasks and
 

6567
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:50,069
actually better for certain tasks and
that certain task is reasoning right um

6568
01:57:50,069 --> 01:57:50,079
that certain task is reasoning right um
 

6569
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:53,030
that certain task is reasoning right um
reasoning is incredibly like different

6570
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
reasoning is incredibly like different
 

6571
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:53,990
reasoning is incredibly like different
than you know when you look at the

6572
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,000
than you know when you look at the
 

6573
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,510
than you know when you look at the
different regimes of models right

6574
01:57:56,510 --> 01:57:56,520
different regimes of models right
 

6575
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:59,189
different regimes of models right
pre-training is all about flops right

6576
01:57:59,189 --> 01:57:59,199
pre-training is all about flops right
 

6577
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:00,550
pre-training is all about flops right
it's all about flops there's things you

6578
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:00,560
it's all about flops there's things you
 

6579
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,189
it's all about flops there's things you
do like mixture of experts that we

6580
01:58:02,189 --> 01:58:02,199
do like mixture of experts that we
 

6581
01:58:02,199 --> 01:58:04,229
do like mixture of experts that we
talked about to trade off interconnect

6582
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:04,239
talked about to trade off interconnect
 

6583
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:06,310
talked about to trade off interconnect
or to trade off you know other aspects

6584
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:06,320
or to trade off you know other aspects
 

6585
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,390
or to trade off you know other aspects
and lower the flops uh and and rely more

6586
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:08,400
and lower the flops uh and and rely more
 

6587
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,470
and lower the flops uh and and rely more
on interconnect and memory but at the

6588
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:10,480
on interconnect and memory but at the
 

6589
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:12,629
on interconnect and memory but at the
end of the day it's flops as everything

6590
01:58:12,629 --> 01:58:12,639
end of the day it's flops as everything
 

6591
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:14,350
end of the day it's flops as everything
right we talk about models in terms of

6592
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:14,360
right we talk about models in terms of
 

6593
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:17,069
right we talk about models in terms of
like how many flops they are right uh so

6594
01:58:17,069 --> 01:58:17,079
like how many flops they are right uh so
 

6595
01:58:17,079 --> 01:58:19,350
like how many flops they are right uh so
so like you know we talk about oh gp4 is

6596
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:19,360
so like you know we talk about oh gp4 is
 

6597
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:22,189
so like you know we talk about oh gp4 is
2 e25 right two to the uh two to the 25

6598
01:58:22,189 --> 01:58:22,199
2 e25 right two to the uh two to the 25
 

6599
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:26,069
2 e25 right two to the uh two to the 25
fth uh you know 25 Z right flop right

6600
01:58:26,069 --> 01:58:26,079
fth uh you know 25 Z right flop right
 

6601
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:28,390
fth uh you know 25 Z right flop right
floating Point operations um for

6602
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:28,400
floating Point operations um for
 

6603
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,149
floating Point operations um for
training for training right and and

6604
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:30,159
training for training right and and
 

6605
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:31,629
training for training right and and
we're talking about the restrictions for

6606
01:58:31,629 --> 01:58:31,639
we're talking about the restrictions for
 

6607
01:58:31,639 --> 01:58:34,669
we're talking about the restrictions for
the uh 224 right 25 what uh the US has

6608
01:58:34,669 --> 01:58:34,679
the uh 224 right 25 what uh the US has
 

6609
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:36,350
the uh 224 right 25 what uh the US has
an executive order that Trump recently

6610
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:36,360
an executive order that Trump recently
 

6611
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:40,189
an executive order that Trump recently
unsigned but um which was hey 1 e26 once

6612
01:58:40,189 --> 01:58:40,199
unsigned but um which was hey 1 e26 once
 

6613
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:41,430
unsigned but um which was hey 1 e26 once
you hit that number of floating Point

6614
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:41,440
you hit that number of floating Point
 

6615
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,790
you hit that number of floating Point
operations you must notify the

6616
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
operations you must notify the
 

6617
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,629
operations you must notify the
government and we you must share your

6618
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
government and we you must share your
 

6619
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,189
government and we you must share your
results with us right like there's a

6620
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:46,199
results with us right like there's a
 

6621
01:58:46,199 --> 01:58:47,629
results with us right like there's a
level of model where the US government

6622
01:58:47,629 --> 01:58:47,639
level of model where the US government
 

6623
01:58:47,639 --> 01:58:50,669
level of model where the US government
must be told right and that's 26 and so

6624
01:58:50,669 --> 01:58:50,679
must be told right and that's 26 and so
 

6625
01:58:50,679 --> 01:58:52,750
must be told right and that's 26 and so
as we move forward this is this is an

6626
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:52,760
as we move forward this is this is an
 

6627
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:54,510
as we move forward this is this is an
incredibly like important flop is the

6628
01:58:54,510 --> 01:58:54,520
incredibly like important flop is the
 

6629
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,750
incredibly like important flop is the
vector that the government has cared

6630
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:55,760
vector that the government has cared
 

6631
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,669
vector that the government has cared
about historically but the other two

6632
01:58:57,669 --> 01:58:57,679
about historically but the other two
 

6633
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:00,550
about historically but the other two
vectors are arguably just as important

6634
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
vectors are arguably just as important
 

6635
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,550
vectors are arguably just as important
right um and especially when we come to

6636
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:02,560
right um and especially when we come to
 

6637
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,430
right um and especially when we come to
this new paradigm which the world is

6638
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:04,440
this new paradigm which the world is
 

6639
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,229
this new paradigm which the world is
only just learning about over the last

6640
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:06,239
only just learning about over the last
 

6641
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:08,750
only just learning about over the last
six months right reasoning and do we

6642
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:08,760
six months right reasoning and do we
 

6643
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,910
six months right reasoning and do we
understand firmly which of the three

6644
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
understand firmly which of the three
 

6645
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,950
understand firmly which of the three
dimensions is best for reasoning so

6646
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:13,960
dimensions is best for reasoning so

right and the attention mechanism
 

6705
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,870
right and the attention mechanism
attention mechanism is that the model

6706
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:10,880
attention mechanism is that the model
 

6707
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:12,669
attention mechanism is that the model
understands the relationships between

all the words in its context right and
 

6711
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,069
all the words in its context right and
that is that is separate from the

02:00:17,069 --> 02:00:17,079
that is that is separate from the
 

6713
02:00:17,079 --> 02:00:19,430
that is that is separate from the
parameters themselves right and that is

6714
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440
parameters themselves right and that is
 

6715
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,189

that is uh something that you must

6716
02:00:21,189 --> 02:00:21,199
that is uh something that you must
 

6717
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:23,470
that is uh something that you must
calculate right how each token right

6718
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:23,480
calculate right how each token right
 

6719
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:26,709
calculate right how each token right
each word in the context length is uh

6720
02:00:26,709 --> 02:00:26,719
each word in the context length is uh
 

6721
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:28,830
each word in the context length is uh
relatively uh connected to each other

6722
02:00:28,830 --> 02:00:28,840
relatively uh connected to each other
 

6723
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,270
relatively uh connected to each other
right and and I think I think Nathan you

6724
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:30,280
right and and I think I think Nathan you
 

6725
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:32,270
right and and I think I think Nathan you
should explain KV Cas better KV Cas is

it's queries keys and values qkv is the
 

6733
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,149
it's queries keys and values qkv is the
thing that goes into this you'll look at

6734
02:00:43,149 --> 02:00:43,159
thing that goes into this you'll look at
 

6735
02:00:43,159 --> 02:00:45,069
thing that goes into this you'll look at
the equation you see that these matrices

6736
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:45,079
the equation you see that these matrices
 

6737
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:47,229
the equation you see that these matrices
are multiplied together these words

6738
02:00:47,229 --> 02:00:47,239
are multiplied together these words
 

6739
02:00:47,239 --> 02:00:48,709
are multiplied together these words
query key and value come from

6740
02:00:48,709 --> 02:00:48,719
query key and value come from
 

6741
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:50,430
query key and value come from
information retrieval backgrounds where

6742
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:50,440
information retrieval backgrounds where
 

6743
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,870
information retrieval backgrounds where
the query is the thing you're trying to

6744
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:52,880
the query is the thing you're trying to
 

6745
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,709
the query is the thing you're trying to
get the values for and you access the

6746
02:00:54,709 --> 02:00:54,719
get the values for and you access the
 

6747
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:56,669
get the values for and you access the
keys and the values is reting my

6748
02:00:56,669 --> 02:00:56,679
keys and the values is reting my
 

6749
02:00:56,679 --> 02:00:58,229
keys and the values is reting my
background's not an information

6750
02:00:58,229 --> 02:00:58,239
background's not an information
 

6751
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:59,470
background's not an information
retrieval and things like this it's just

6752
02:00:59,470 --> 02:00:59,480
retrieval and things like this it's just
 

6753
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:02,589
retrieval and things like this it's just
fun to have backlinks and what

6754
02:01:02,589 --> 02:01:02,599
fun to have backlinks and what
 

6755
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:04,629
fun to have backlinks and what
effectively happens is that when you're

6756
02:01:04,629 --> 02:01:04,639
effectively happens is that when you're
 

6757
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,149
effectively happens is that when you're
doing these Matrix multiplications

6758
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:06,159
doing these Matrix multiplications
 

6759
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:08,550
doing these Matrix multiplications
you're having matrices that are of the

6760
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,560
you're having matrices that are of the
 

6761
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,149
you're having matrices that are of the
size of the context length so the number

6762
02:01:10,149 --> 02:01:10,159
size of the context length so the number
 

6763
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:11,910
size of the context length so the number
of tokens that you put into the model

6764
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:11,920
of tokens that you put into the model
 

6765
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,510
of tokens that you put into the model
and the KV cache is effectively some

6766
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:15,520
and the KV cache is effectively some
 

6767
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,430
and the KV cache is effectively some
form of compressed representation of all

6768
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:17,440
form of compressed representation of all
 

6769
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,629
form of compressed representation of all
the previous tokens in the model so when

6770
02:01:19,629 --> 02:01:19,639
the previous tokens in the model so when
 

6771
02:01:19,639 --> 02:01:21,390
the previous tokens in the model so when
you you're doing this we talk about Auto

6772
02:01:21,390 --> 02:01:21,400
you you're doing this we talk about Auto
 

6773
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,390
you you're doing this we talk about Auto
regressive model models you predict one

6774
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:23,400
regressive model models you predict one
 

6775
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:25,350
regressive model models you predict one
token at a time you start with whatever

6776
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:25,360
token at a time you start with whatever
 

6777
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,550
token at a time you start with whatever
your prompt was you ask a question like

6778
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:27,560
your prompt was you ask a question like
 

6779
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,629
your prompt was you ask a question like
who was the president in 1825 the model

6780
02:01:30,629 --> 02:01:30,639
who was the president in 1825 the model
 

6781
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:31,950
who was the president in 1825 the model
then is going to generate its first

6782
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:31,960
then is going to generate its first
 

6783
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,350
then is going to generate its first
token for each of these tokens you're

6784
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:34,360
token for each of these tokens you're
 

6785
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:36,270
token for each of these tokens you're
doing the same attention operator where

6786
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:36,280
doing the same attention operator where
 

6787
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:39,350
doing the same attention operator where
you're multiplying these query key value

6788
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:39,360
you're multiplying these query key value
 

6789
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:42,790
you're multiplying these query key value
matrices but it the math is very nice so

6790
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:42,800
matrices but it the math is very nice so
 

6791
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:44,830
matrices but it the math is very nice so
that when you're doing this repeatedly

6792
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:44,840
that when you're doing this repeatedly
 

6793
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:48,910
that when you're doing this repeatedly
this KV cache this key value operation

6794
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:48,920
this KV cache this key value operation
 

6795
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,950
this KV cache this key value operation
you can keep appending the new values to

6796
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:50,960
you can keep appending the new values to
 

6797
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,990
you can keep appending the new values to
it so you keep track of what your

6798
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:53,000
it so you keep track of what your
 

6799
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,149
it so you keep track of what your
previous values you inferring over in

6800
02:01:55,149 --> 02:01:55,159
previous values you inferring over in
 

6801
02:01:55,159 --> 02:01:57,069
previous values you inferring over in
this Auto regressive chain you keep it

6802
02:01:57,069 --> 02:01:57,079

02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:29,760
computations in attention and it just it
 

6889
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,910

02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:34,709
it changes the architecture but serving
long contexts is extremely memory

don't know why input and output tokens

6898
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:40,520
don't know why input and output tokens
 

6899
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,550
don't know why input and output tokens
are more expensive but I think

6900
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:41,560
are more expensive but I think
 

6901
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:43,470
are more expensive but I think
essentially output tokens you have to do

6902
02:03:43,470 --> 02:03:43,480
essentially output tokens you have to do
 

6903
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:44,750
essentially output tokens you have to do
more computation because you have to

6904
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:44,760
more computation because you have to
 

6905
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:46,270
more computation because you have to

explain that so today if you use a model

6908
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:48,760
explain that so today if you use a model

02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,709
explain that so today if you use a model
uh like you look at an API open AI

6910
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:50,719
uh like you look at an API open AI

uh like you look at an API open AI
charges you know certain price per

6912
02:03:53,549 --> 02:03:53,559
charges you know certain price per
 

6913
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:55,629
charges you know certain price per
million tokens right uh and that price

6914
02:03:55,629 --> 02:03:55,639
million tokens right uh and that price
 

6915
02:03:55,639 --> 02:03:57,669
million tokens right uh and that price
for input and output tokens is different

6916
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
for input and output tokens is different
 

6917
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,870
for input and output tokens is different
right and the reason is is that there is

6918
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:00,880
right and the reason is is that there is
 

6919
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:02,270
right and the reason is is that there is
you know when you're when you're when

6920
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:02,280
you know when you're when you're when
 

6921
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:03,870
you know when you're when you're when
you're inputting a query into the model

6922
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:03,880
you're inputting a query into the model
 

6923
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,109
you're inputting a query into the model
right let's say you have a book right

6924
02:04:06,109 --> 02:04:06,119
right let's say you have a book right
 

6925
02:04:06,119 --> 02:04:07,750
right let's say you have a book right
that book you must now calculate the

6926
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:07,760
that book you must now calculate the
 

6927
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,709
that book you must now calculate the
entire KV cache for right this key value

6928
02:04:09,709 --> 02:04:09,719
entire KV cache for right this key value
 

6929
02:04:09,719 --> 02:04:12,229
entire KV cache for right this key value
cache and so when you do that that is a

6930
02:04:12,229 --> 02:04:12,239
cache and so when you do that that is a
 

6931
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:14,430
cache and so when you do that that is a
parallel operation all of the tokens can

6932
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:14,440
parallel operation all of the tokens can
 

6933
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,510
parallel operation all of the tokens can
be processed at one time and therefore

6934
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:16,520
be processed at one time and therefore
 

6935
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,270
be processed at one time and therefore
you can dramatically reduce how much

6936
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:18,280
you can dramatically reduce how much
 

6937
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:19,790
you can dramatically reduce how much
you're spending right the Flop

6938
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:19,800
you're spending right the Flop
 

6939
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,229
you're spending right the Flop
requirements for generating a token and

6940
02:04:22,229 --> 02:04:22,239
requirements for generating a token and
 

6941
02:04:22,239 --> 02:04:24,510
requirements for generating a token and
and input token are identical right if I

6942
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:24,520
and input token are identical right if I
 

6943
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:25,950
and input token are identical right if I
input one token or if I generate one

6944
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:25,960
input one token or if I generate one
 

6945
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:27,589
input one token or if I generate one
token it's completely identical I have

6946
02:04:27,589 --> 02:04:27,599
token it's completely identical I have
 

6947
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:29,470
token it's completely identical I have
to go through the model right but the

6948
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:29,480
to go through the model right but the
 

6949
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:31,629
to go through the model right but the
difference is that I can do that input

6950
02:04:31,629 --> 02:04:31,639
difference is that I can do that input
 

6951
02:04:31,639 --> 02:04:34,589
difference is that I can do that input

6957
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,149
right and therefore it is all flop I
think the pricing model mostly they use

02:04:41,149 --> 02:04:41,159
think the pricing model mostly they use
 

6959
02:04:41,159 --> 02:04:43,350
think the pricing model mostly they use
is for input tokens is about 1/4 the

6960
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:43,360
is for input tokens is about 1/4 the
 

6961
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:44,830
is for input tokens is about 1/4 the
price of the output tokens correct but

6962
02:04:44,830 --> 02:04:44,840
price of the output tokens correct but
 

6963
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:46,709
price of the output tokens correct but
then output tokens the reason why it's

6964
02:04:46,709 --> 02:04:46,719
then output tokens the reason why it's
 

6965
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:48,189
then output tokens the reason why it's
so expensive is because I can't do it in

6966
02:04:48,189 --> 02:04:48,199
so expensive is because I can't do it in
 

6967
02:04:48,199 --> 02:04:49,870
so expensive is because I can't do it in
parallel right it's Auto regressive

6968
02:04:49,870 --> 02:04:49,880
parallel right it's Auto regressive
 

6969
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,229
parallel right it's Auto regressive
every time I generate a token I must not

6970
02:04:52,229 --> 02:04:52,239
every time I generate a token I must not
 

6971
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:54,270
every time I generate a token I must not
only take the entire I must not only

6972
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:54,280
only take the entire I must not only
 

6973
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:56,270
only take the entire I must not only
read the whole entire model into memory

6974
02:04:56,270 --> 02:04:56,280
read the whole entire model into memory
 

6975
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,229
read the whole entire model into memory
right and and activate it right go

6976
02:04:58,229 --> 02:04:58,239
right and and activate it right go
 

6977
02:04:58,239 --> 02:04:59,790
right and and activate it right go
calculate it to generate the next token

6978
02:04:59,790 --> 02:04:59,800
calculate it to generate the next token
 

6979
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:01,669
calculate it to generate the next token
I also have to read the entire KV cache

6980
02:05:01,669 --> 02:05:01,679
I also have to read the entire KV cache
 

6981
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:03,629
I also have to read the entire KV cache
and I generate a token and I append that

6982
02:05:03,629 --> 02:05:03,639
and I generate a token and I append that
 

6983
02:05:03,639 --> 02:05:05,629
and I generate a token and I append that
KV that one token I generated and it's

6984
02:05:05,629 --> 02:05:05,639
KV that one token I generated and it's
 

6985
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:07,629
KV that one token I generated and it's
KV cache and then I do it again right

6986
02:05:07,629 --> 02:05:07,639
KV cache and then I do it again right
 

6987
02:05:07,639 --> 02:05:10,069
KV cache and then I do it again right
and so therefore this is a non-parallel

6988
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:10,079
and so therefore this is a non-parallel
 

6989
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:12,910
and so therefore this is a non-parallel
operation and this is one where uh you

6990
02:05:12,910 --> 02:05:12,920
operation and this is one where uh you
 

6991
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,430
operation and this is one where uh you
have to you know in in the case of

6992
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:14,440
have to you know in in the case of
 

6993
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:16,549
have to you know in in the case of
prefill or prompt you pull the whole

6994
02:05:16,549 --> 02:05:16,559
prefill or prompt you pull the whole
 

6995
02:05:16,559 --> 02:05:19,310
prefill or prompt you pull the whole
model in and you calculate 20,000 tokens

6996
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:19,320
model in and you calculate 20,000 tokens
 

6997
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,189
model in and you calculate 20,000 tokens
at once right these are features that

6998
02:05:21,189 --> 02:05:21,199
at once right these are features that
 

6999
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:23,990

prompt caching pre-filling because you

7002
02:05:26,069 --> 02:05:26,079
prompt caching pre-filling because you
 

7003
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:27,510
prompt caching pre-filling because you
can drive prices down and you can make

7004
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:27,520
can drive prices down and you can make
 

7005
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:28,950
can drive prices down and you can make
apis much faster if you know you're

7007
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,510
apis much faster if you know you're
going to keep if you run a business and

7008
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:30,520
going to keep if you run a business and
 

7009
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,189
going to keep if you run a business and
you're going to keep passing the same

initial content to Cloud's API you can

7012
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:34,840
initial content to Cloud's API you can
 

7013
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:37,350
initial content to Cloud's API you can
load that in to the anthropic API and

7014
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:37,360
load that in to the anthropic API and
 

7015
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,030
load that in to the anthropic API and
always keep it there but it's very

7016
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,040
always keep it there but it's very
 

7017
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,350
always keep it there but it's very

02:05:47,229 --> 02:05:47,239
some of this kind of mumbling stuff and
 

7025
02:05:47,239 --> 02:05:50,189
some of this kind of mumbling stuff and
what happens is that the output context

7026
02:05:50,189 --> 02:05:50,199
what happens is that the output context
 

7027
02:05:50,199 --> 02:05:52,069
what happens is that the output context

02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,950
to serve multiple requests at once so
doing this batch processing where not

02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,470
very different idea right now instead I
might have I might only have like hey do

7112
02:07:17,470 --> 02:07:17,480
might have I might only have like hey do
 

7113
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:18,589
might have I might only have like hey do
this task or I might have all these

7114
02:07:18,589 --> 02:07:18,599
this task or I might have all these
 

7115
02:07:18,599 --> 02:07:20,589
this task or I might have all these
documents but at the end of the day the

7116
02:07:20,589 --> 02:07:20,599
documents but at the end of the day the
 

7117
02:07:20,599 --> 02:07:21,990
documents but at the end of the day the
model is not just like producing a

7118
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:22,000
model is not just like producing a
 

7119
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,310
model is not just like producing a
little bit right it's producing tons of

7120
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:24,320
little bit right it's producing tons of
 

7121
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,069
little bit right it's producing tons of
information this Chain of Thought just

7122
02:07:26,069 --> 02:07:26,079
information this Chain of Thought just
 

7123
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:28,470
information this Chain of Thought just
continues to go and go and go and go and

7124
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:28,480
continues to go and go and go and go and
 

7125
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,629
continues to go and go and go and go and
so the sequence length is is effectively

7126
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:30,639
so the sequence length is is effectively
 

7127
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:31,830
so the sequence length is is effectively
that that you know if it's generated

7128
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:31,840
that that you know if it's generated
 

7129
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,189
that that you know if it's generated
10,000 tokens it's 10,000 sequence

7130
02:07:34,189 --> 02:07:34,199
10,000 tokens it's 10,000 sequence
 

7131
02:07:34,199 --> 02:07:36,069
10,000 tokens it's 10,000 sequence
length right or and and plus whatever

7132
02:07:36,069 --> 02:07:36,079
length right or and and plus whatever
 

7133
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:37,830
length right or and and plus whatever
you input it in the prompt and so what

7134
02:07:37,830 --> 02:07:37,840
you input it in the prompt and so what
 

7135
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:38,830
you input it in the prompt and so what
this chart is showing and it's a

7136
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:38,840
this chart is showing and it's a
 

7137
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:42,030
this chart is showing and it's a
logarithmic chart right is um you know

7138
02:07:42,030 --> 02:07:42,040
logarithmic chart right is um you know
 

7139
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:46,270
logarithmic chart right is um you know
as you grow from 1K to 4K or 4K to 16k

7140
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:46,280
as you grow from 1K to 4K or 4K to 16k
 

7141
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:49,310
as you grow from 1K to 4K or 4K to 16k
the memory requirements grow so fast for

7142
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:49,320
the memory requirements grow so fast for
 

7143
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:51,669
the memory requirements grow so fast for
your KV cache that you end up not being

7144
02:07:51,669 --> 02:07:51,679
your KV cache that you end up not being
 

7145
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:54,390
your KV cache that you end up not being
able to run uh a certain number of you

7146
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:54,400
able to run uh a certain number of you
 

7147
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:55,990
able to run uh a certain number of you
know uh you know your your sequence

7148
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:56,000
know uh you know your your sequence
 

7149
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,430
know uh you know your your sequence
length is capped or the number of users

7150
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,440
length is capped or the number of users
 

7151
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,990
length is capped or the number of users
you let's say the model so this is this

7152
02:07:58,990 --> 02:07:59,000
you let's say the model so this is this
 

7153
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,390
you let's say the model so this is this
is showing for a 405b model in batch

7154
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:01,400
is showing for a 405b model in batch
 

7155
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:04,790
is showing for a 405b model in batch
size 64 llama 31 405b yeah yeah and

7156
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:04,800
size 64 llama 31 405b yeah yeah and
 

7157
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,910
size 64 llama 31 405b yeah yeah and
batch size is crucial to essentially

7158
02:08:06,910 --> 02:08:06,920
batch size is crucial to essentially
 

7159
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:08,470
batch size is crucial to essentially
they just like you want to have higher

7160
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:08,480
they just like you want to have higher
 

7161
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:11,229
they just like you want to have higher
batch size to parallelize parallel your

7162
02:08:11,229 --> 02:08:11,239
batch size to parallelize parallel your
 

7163
02:08:11,239 --> 02:08:13,109
batch size to parallelize parallel your
through 64 different users at once right

7164
02:08:13,109 --> 02:08:13,119
through 64 different users at once right
 

7165
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:14,510
through 64 different users at once right
yeah and therefore your serving costs

7166
02:08:14,510 --> 02:08:14,520
yeah and therefore your serving costs
 

7167
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,830
yeah and therefore your serving costs
are lower right because the server cost

7168
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:15,840
are lower right because the server cost
 

7169
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:18,830
are lower right because the server cost
the same right this is8 h100s roughly $2

7170
02:08:18,830 --> 02:08:18,840
the same right this is8 h100s roughly $2
 

7171
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:21,629
the same right this is8 h100s roughly $2
an hour per GPU that's $16 an hour right

7172
02:08:21,629 --> 02:08:21,639
an hour per GPU that's $16 an hour right
 

7173
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:23,310
an hour per GPU that's $16 an hour right
that is that is like somewhat of a fixed

7174
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:23,320
that is that is like somewhat of a fixed
 

7175
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,830
that is that is like somewhat of a fixed
cost you can do things to make it lower

7176
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:24,840
cost you can do things to make it lower
 

7177
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,830
cost you can do things to make it lower
of course but like it's like $16 an hour

7178
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:26,840
of course but like it's like $16 an hour
 

7179
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,629
of course but like it's like $16 an hour
now how many users can you serve how

7180
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:28,639
now how many users can you serve how
 

7181
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:30,189
now how many users can you serve how
many tokens can you generate and then

7182
02:08:30,189 --> 02:08:30,199
many tokens can you generate and then
 

7183
02:08:30,199 --> 02:08:31,629
many tokens can you generate and then
you divide the two and that's your cost

7184
02:08:31,629 --> 02:08:31,639
you divide the two and that's your cost
 

7185
02:08:31,639 --> 02:08:34,589
you divide the two and that's your cost
right um and so with reasoning models

7186
02:08:34,589 --> 02:08:34,599
right um and so with reasoning models
 

7187
02:08:34,599 --> 02:08:36,149
right um and so with reasoning models
this is this is where a lot of the

7188
02:08:36,149 --> 02:08:36,159
this is this is where a lot of the
 

7189
02:08:36,159 --> 02:08:37,950
this is this is where a lot of the
complexity comes about and why memory is

7190
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:37,960
complexity comes about and why memory is
 

7191
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:40,149
complexity comes about and why memory is
so important because if you have limited

7192
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,159
so important because if you have limited
 

7193
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:42,069
so important because if you have limited
amounts of memory then you can't serve

7194
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,079
amounts of memory then you can't serve
 

7195
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:43,629
amounts of memory then you can't serve
so many users if you have limited

7196
02:08:43,629 --> 02:08:43,639
so many users if you have limited
 

7197
02:08:43,639 --> 02:08:45,470
so many users if you have limited
amounts of memory your serving speeds

7198
02:08:45,470 --> 02:08:45,480
amounts of memory your serving speeds
 

7199
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:47,470
amounts of memory your serving speeds
get lower right and so your costs get a

7200
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:47,480
get lower right and so your costs get a
 

7201
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:50,069
get lower right and so your costs get a
lot lot worse um because all of a sudden

7202
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:50,079
lot lot worse um because all of a sudden
 

7203
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:52,629
lot lot worse um because all of a sudden
if I was used to hey on this $16 an hour

right and the so cheap we kind of talked

02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,270
right and the so cheap we kind of talked

7413
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:29,149
than 01 we think that open AI had a
large margin built in okay so that's

7414
02:12:29,149 --> 02:12:29,159
large margin built in okay so that's
 

7415
02:12:29,159 --> 02:12:30,390
large margin built in okay so that's
there's multiple factors we should break

7416
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:30,400
there's multiple factors we should break
 

7417
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,430
there's multiple factors we should break
down the factors I think it's two bucks

7418
02:12:32,430 --> 02:12:32,440
down the factors I think it's two bucks
 

7419
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:36,069
down the factors I think it's two bucks
per million token output for R1 and

7420
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:36,079
per million token output for R1 and
 

7421
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:40,830
per million token output for R1 and
$60 uh per million token output for 01

7422
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:40,840
$60 uh per million token output for 01
 

7423
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:42,189
$60 uh per million token output for 01
yeah let's look at

7424
02:12:42,189 --> 02:12:42,199
yeah let's look at
 

7425
02:12:42,199 --> 02:12:44,669
yeah let's look at
this so so I think this is is very

7426
02:12:44,669 --> 02:12:44,679
this so so I think this is is very
 

7427
02:12:44,679 --> 02:12:47,510
this so so I think this is is very
important right open AI is you know that

7428
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:47,520
important right open AI is you know that
 

7429
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,149
important right open AI is you know that
drastic gap between deep seek and

7430
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
drastic gap between deep seek and
 

7431
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:52,430
drastic gap between deep seek and
pricing but seek is offering the same

7432
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:52,440
pricing but seek is offering the same
 

7433
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:54,229
pricing but seek is offering the same
model because they open weight it to

7434
02:12:54,229 --> 02:12:54,239
model because they open weight it to
 

7435
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:56,629
model because they open weight it to
everyone else for a very similar like

7436
02:12:56,629 --> 02:12:56,639
everyone else for a very similar like
 

7437
02:12:56,639 --> 02:12:57,990
everyone else for a very similar like
much lower price than what others are

7438
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:58,000
much lower price than what others are
 

7439
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,390
much lower price than what others are
able to serve it for right um so there's

7440
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:00,400
able to serve it for right um so there's
 

7441
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:01,910
able to serve it for right um so there's
there's two factors here right their

7442
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:01,920
there's two factors here right their
 

7443
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,750
there's two factors here right their
model is cheaper right um it is 27 times

7444
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:04,760
model is cheaper right um it is 27 times
 

7445
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,030
model is cheaper right um it is 27 times
cheaper I don't remember the number

7446
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:06,040
cheaper I don't remember the number
 

7447
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:07,589
cheaper I don't remember the number
exactly off top of my head so we're

7448
02:13:07,589 --> 02:13:07,599
exactly off top of my head so we're
 

7449
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:10,270
exactly off top of my head so we're
looking at a graphic that's showing

7450
02:13:10,270 --> 02:13:10,280
looking at a graphic that's showing
 

7451
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:14,709
looking at a graphic that's showing
different places serving V3 deep seek V3

7452
02:13:14,709 --> 02:13:14,719
different places serving V3 deep seek V3
 

7453
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:17,910
different places serving V3 deep seek V3
which is similar to deep seek R1 and

7454
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:17,920
which is similar to deep seek R1 and
 

7455
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:21,390
which is similar to deep seek R1 and
there's a vast difference in uh serving

7456
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:21,400
there's a vast difference in uh serving
 

7457
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:22,790
there's a vast difference in uh serving
cost right serving cost and what

7458
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:22,800
cost right serving cost and what
 

7459
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,629
cost right serving cost and what
explains that difference and and and so

7460
02:13:24,629 --> 02:13:24,639
explains that difference and and and so
 

7461
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:26,149
explains that difference and and and so
like part of it is open a has a

7462
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:26,159
like part of it is open a has a
 

7463
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,069
like part of it is open a has a
fantastic margin right they're serving

7464
02:13:28,069 --> 02:13:28,079
fantastic margin right they're serving
 

7465
02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:29,390
fantastic margin right they're serving
when they're doing inference their gross

7466
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:29,400
when they're doing inference their gross
 

7467
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:32,069
when they're doing inference their gross
margins are north of 75% right so that's

7468
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:32,079
margins are north of 75% right so that's
 

7469
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:34,549
margins are north of 75% right so that's
that's a four to 5x Factor right there

7470
02:13:34,549 --> 02:13:34,559
that's a four to 5x Factor right there
 

7471
02:13:34,559 --> 02:13:36,069
that's a four to 5x Factor right there
of the cost difference is that open ey

7472
02:13:36,069 --> 02:13:36,079
of the cost difference is that open ey
 

7473
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:38,270
of the cost difference is that open ey
is just making crazy amounts of money

7474
02:13:38,270 --> 02:13:38,280
is just making crazy amounts of money
 

7475
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,270
is just making crazy amounts of money
because they're the only one with a

7476
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:39,280
because they're the only one with a
 

7477
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,270
because they're the only one with a
capability do they need that money are

7478
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:41,280
capability do they need that money are
 

7479
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,990
capability do they need that money are
they using it for R&D they're losing

7480
02:13:42,990 --> 02:13:43,000
they using it for R&D they're losing
 

7481
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,510
they using it for R&D they're losing
money obviously as a company because

7482
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:44,520
money obviously as a company because
 

7483
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:46,109
money obviously as a company because
they spend so much on training right so

7484
02:13:46,109 --> 02:13:46,119
they spend so much on training right so
 

7485
02:13:46,119 --> 02:13:47,629
they spend so much on training right so
the inference itself is a very high

7486
02:13:47,629 --> 02:13:47,639
the inference itself is a very high
 

7487
02:13:47,639 --> 02:13:49,390
the inference itself is a very high
margin but it doesn't recoup the cost of

7488
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:49,400
margin but it doesn't recoup the cost of
 

7489
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:51,549
margin but it doesn't recoup the cost of
everything else they're doing okay so

7490
02:13:51,549 --> 02:13:51,559
everything else they're doing okay so
 

7491
02:13:51,559 --> 02:13:53,109
everything else they're doing okay so
yes they need that money because the

7492
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:53,119
yes they need that money because the
 

7493
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:55,549
yes they need that money because the
revenue and margins pay for continuing

7494
02:13:55,549 --> 02:13:55,559
revenue and margins pay for continuing
 

7495
02:13:55,559 --> 02:13:56,709
revenue and margins pay for continuing
to build the next thing right as

7496
02:13:56,709 --> 02:13:56,719
to build the next thing right as
 

7497
02:13:56,719 --> 02:13:58,149
to build the next thing right as
alongside raising more money so the

7498
02:13:58,149 --> 02:13:58,159
alongside raising more money so the
 

7499
02:13:58,159 --> 02:13:59,669
alongside raising more money so the
suggestion is that deep seek is like

7500
02:13:59,669 --> 02:13:59,679
suggestion is that deep seek is like
 

7501
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:01,589
suggestion is that deep seek is like
really bleeding out money well so so

7502
02:14:01,589 --> 02:14:01,599
really bleeding out money well so so
 

7503
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:03,270
really bleeding out money well so so
here's one thing right we'll get to this

7504
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:03,280
here's one thing right we'll get to this
 

7505
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,430
here's one thing right we'll get to this
in a second but like deep seek doesn't

7506
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:05,440
in a second but like deep seek doesn't
 

7507
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,950
in a second but like deep seek doesn't
have any capacity to actually serve the

7508
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:06,960
have any capacity to actually serve the
 

7509
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:10,069
have any capacity to actually serve the
monel they sto signups uh the ability to

7510
02:14:10,069 --> 02:14:10,079
monel they sto signups uh the ability to
 

7511
02:14:10,079 --> 02:14:12,270
monel they sto signups uh the ability to
use it is like non-existent now right

7512
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:12,280
use it is like non-existent now right
 

7513
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,830
use it is like non-existent now right
for most people because so many people

7514
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:13,840
for most people because so many people
 

7515
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:14,950
for most people because so many people
are trying to use it they just don't

7516
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:14,960
are trying to use it they just don't
 

7517
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,390
are trying to use it they just don't
have the gpus to serve it right um open

7518
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:17,400
have the gpus to serve it right um open
 

7519
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,790
have the gpus to serve it right um open
has hundreds of thousands of gpus

7520
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:18,800
has hundreds of thousands of gpus
 

7521
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,229
has hundreds of thousands of gpus
between them and Microsoft to serve

7522
02:14:20,229 --> 02:14:20,239
between them and Microsoft to serve
 

7523
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:22,709
between them and Microsoft to serve
their models deep seek has has a factor

7524
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:22,719
their models deep seek has has a factor
 

7525
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:24,549
their models deep seek has has a factor
of much lower right you know even if you

7526
02:14:24,549 --> 02:14:24,559
of much lower right you know even if you
 

7527
02:14:24,559 --> 02:14:26,149
of much lower right you know even if you
believe our research which is 50,000

7528
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:26,159
believe our research which is 50,000
 

7529
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:28,189
believe our research which is 50,000
gpus uh and a portion of those are for

research portion of those are for the
 

7533
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,189
research portion of those are for the
hedge fund right they still have nowhere

7534
02:14:31,189 --> 02:14:31,199
hedge fund right they still have nowhere
 

7535
02:14:31,199 --> 02:14:33,069
hedge fund right they still have nowhere
close to the GPU volumes and capacity to

7536
02:14:33,069 --> 02:14:33,079
close to the GPU volumes and capacity to
 

7537
02:14:33,079 --> 02:14:36,589
close to the GPU volumes and capacity to
serve the model right at scale um so it

7538
02:14:36,589 --> 02:14:36,599
serve the model right at scale um so it
 

7539
02:14:36,599 --> 02:14:39,109
serve the model right at scale um so it
is cheaper uh a part of that is open eye

7540
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:39,119
is cheaper uh a part of that is open eye
 

7541
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:40,629
is cheaper uh a part of that is open eye
making a ton of money is deep seek

not not tons of money on inference but

7566
02:15:04,189 --> 02:15:04,199
not not tons of money on inference but
 

7567
02:15:04,199 --> 02:15:05,669
not not tons of money on inference but
they make money and so they're serving

7568

at like a 5 to 7x difference in cost
 

7571
02:15:08,719 --> 02:15:10,870
at like a 5 to 7x difference in cost
right and so you know now when you when

7572
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:10,880
right and so you know now when you when
 

7573
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,350
right and so you know now when you when
you equate okay open ey is making tons

7574
02:15:12,350 --> 02:15:12,360
you equate okay open ey is making tons
 

7575
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:14,350
you equate okay open ey is making tons
of money that's like a 5x difference um

7576
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:14,360
of money that's like a 5x difference um
 

7577
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,310
of money that's like a 5x difference um
and the companies that are trying to

7578
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:15,320
and the companies that are trying to
 

7579
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:16,830
and the companies that are trying to
make money for this model is like a 5x

7580
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:16,840
make money for this model is like a 5x
 

7581
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,549
make money for this model is like a 5x
difference there is still a gap right

7582
02:15:18,549 --> 02:15:18,559
difference there is still a gap right
 

7583
02:15:18,559 --> 02:15:19,709
difference there is still a gap right
there's still a gap and that is just

7584
02:15:19,709 --> 02:15:19,719
there's still a gap and that is just
 

7585
02:15:19,719 --> 02:15:21,629
there's still a gap and that is just
deep seek being really freaking good

7586
02:15:21,629 --> 02:15:21,639
deep seek being really freaking good
 

7587
02:15:21,639 --> 02:15:23,830
deep seek being really freaking good
right the model architecture MLA the way

7588
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:23,840
right the model architecture MLA the way
 

7589
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:26,109
right the model architecture MLA the way
they did the all these things there is

7720
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:34,240
model I think they're just shipping as
 

7721
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,870
model I think they're just shipping as
fast as they can and like who cares

7722
02:17:35,870 --> 02:17:35,880
fast as they can and like who cares
 

7723
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,429
fast as they can and like who cares
about Christmas who cares about you know

7724
02:17:37,429 --> 02:17:37,439
about Christmas who cares about you know
 

7725
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:38,790
about Christmas who cares about you know
get it out before Chinese New Year right

7726
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:38,800
get it out before Chinese New Year right
 

7727
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,950
get it out before Chinese New Year right
obviously which just happened um I don't

7728
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:40,960
obviously which just happened um I don't
 

7729

think they actually were like timing the

7730
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
think they actually were like timing the
 

7731
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,349
think they actually were like timing the
market or trying to make the biggest

7732
02:17:44,349 --> 02:17:44,359
market or trying to make the biggest
 

7733
02:17:44,359 --> 02:17:45,629
market or trying to make the biggest
splash possible I think they're just

7734
02:17:45,629 --> 02:17:45,639
splash possible I think they're just
 

7735
02:17:45,639 --> 02:17:47,230
splash possible I think they're just
like shipping I think that's one of

7736
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:47,240
like shipping I think that's one of
 

7737
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:49,549
like shipping I think that's one of
their big advantages I we know that a

7738
02:17:49,549 --> 02:17:49,559
their big advantages I we know that a
 

7739
02:17:49,559 --> 02:17:51,070
their big advantages I we know that a
lot of the American companies are very

7740
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:51,080
lot of the American companies are very
 

7741
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:53,669
lot of the American companies are very
invested in safety and that is the

7742
02:17:53,669 --> 02:17:53,679
invested in safety and that is the
 

7743
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:55,469
invested in safety and that is the
central culture of a place like

7744
02:17:55,469 --> 02:17:55,479
central culture of a place like
 

7745
02:17:55,479 --> 02:17:57,549
central culture of a place like
anthropic and I think anthropic sounds

7746
02:17:57,549 --> 02:17:57,559
anthropic and I think anthropic sounds
 

7747
02:17:57,559 --> 02:17:59,830
anthropic and I think anthropic sounds
like a wonderful place to work but if

7748
02:17:59,830 --> 02:17:59,840
like a wonderful place to work but if
 

7749
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,790
like a wonderful place to work but if
safety is your number one goal it takes

7750
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:02,800
safety is your number one goal it takes
 

7751
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:04,669
safety is your number one goal it takes
way longer to get artifacts out that's

7752
02:18:04,669 --> 02:18:04,679
way longer to get artifacts out that's
 

7753
02:18:04,679 --> 02:18:06,389
way longer to get artifacts out that's
why anthropic is not open sourcing

7754
02:18:06,389 --> 02:18:06,399
why anthropic is not open sourcing

said Claude 3.5 Sonet was trained like

7786
02:18:40,629 --> 02:18:40,639
said Claude 3.5 Sonet was trained like
 

7787
02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:42,589
said Claude 3.5 Sonet was trained like
nine months or year months ago 9 to 10

7788
02:18:42,589 --> 02:18:42,599
nine months or year months ago 9 to 10
 

7789
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:43,870
nine months or year months ago 9 to 10
months ago and I think it took them

7790
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:43,880
months ago and I think it took them
 

7791
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:45,629
months ago and I think it took them
another like handful of months to

another like handful of months to
 

7793
02:18:45,639 --> 02:18:47,629
another like handful of months to
release it right so it's like there is

7794
02:18:47,629 --> 02:18:47,639
release it right so it's like there is
 

7795
02:18:47,639 --> 02:18:49,750
release it right so it's like there is
there is a significant Gap here right

02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,760
there is a significant Gap here right
 

7797
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:52,070
there is a significant Gap here right
and especially with in models uh the

and especially with in models uh the
 

7799
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:54,070
and especially with in models uh the
word in the San Francisco street is that

7800
02:18:54,070 --> 02:18:54,080
word in the San Francisco street is that
 

7801
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,790
word in the San Francisco street is that
like anthropic has a better model than

7802

like anthropic has a better model than
 

7803

like anthropic has a better model than
03 right and they won't release it why

7804
02:18:58,389 --> 02:18:58,399
03 right and they won't release it why
 

7805
02:18:58,399 --> 02:19:00,910
03 right and they won't release it why
because chains of thought are scary

this it's amazing I mean you talked
 

7827
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,309
this it's amazing I mean you talked
about that uh sort of like uh Chain of

02:19:21,309 --> 02:19:21,319
about that uh sort of like uh Chain of
 

7829
02:19:21,319 --> 02:19:22,509
about that uh sort of like uh Chain of
Thought for that philosophical thing

Thought for that philosophical thing
 

7831
02:19:22,519 --> 02:19:23,950

which is not something they trained to

7832
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:23,960
which is not something they trained to
 

7833
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:25,230
which is not something they trained to
it to be philosophically good it's just

7834
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:25,240
it to be philosophically good it's just
 

7835
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:26,549
it to be philosophically good it's just
sort of an artifact of the Chain of

sort of an artifact of the Chain of
 

7837
02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:28,910
sort of an artifact of the Chain of
Thought training it did um but like

7838
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:28,920
Thought training it did um but like
 

7839
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:32,030
Thought training it did um but like
that's super important in that like can

7840
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:32,040
that's super important in that like can

more task versus like response is very
 

7873
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:03,469
more task versus like response is very
different right so the bar for safety is

7874
02:20:03,469 --> 02:20:03,479
different right so the bar for safety is
 

7875
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:05,710
different right so the bar for safety is
much higher at least this is anthropic

7876
02:20:05,710 --> 02:20:05,720
much higher at least this is anthropic
 

7877
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:07,309
much higher at least this is anthropic
case right like for deep seek they're

7878
02:20:07,309 --> 02:20:07,319
case right like for deep seek they're
 

7879
02:20:07,319 --> 02:20:10,110
case right like for deep seek they're
like ship right yeah so I mean the bar

7880
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:10,120
like ship right yeah so I mean the bar
 

7881
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:12,790
like ship right yeah so I mean the bar
for safety is probably lowered a bit

7882
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:12,800
for safety is probably lowered a bit
 

7883
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:14,270
for safety is probably lowered a bit
because of deep seek I mean there's

7884
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:14,280
because of deep seek I mean there's
 

7885
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,469
because of deep seek I mean there's
parallels here to the Space Race the

7886
02:20:16,469 --> 02:20:16,479
parallels here to the Space Race the
 

7887
02:20:16,479 --> 02:20:18,710
parallels here to the Space Race the
reason the Soviets probably put a man in

7888
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:18,720
reason the Soviets probably put a man in
 

7889
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:22,389
reason the Soviets probably put a man in
space first is cuz

7890
02:20:22,389 --> 02:20:22,399
space first is cuz
 

7891
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:24,870
space first is cuz
the their approach to safety was uh the

7892
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:24,880
the their approach to safety was uh the
 

7893
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,670
the their approach to safety was uh the
bar for safety was lower and they they

7894
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:26,680
bar for safety was lower and they they
 

7895
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:27,950
bar for safety was lower and they they
killed that dog right and all these

7896
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:27,960
killed that dog right and all these
 

7897
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,870
killed that dog right and all these
things right so it's like a less risk

7898
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:29,880
things right so it's like a less risk
 

7899
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,030
things right so it's like a less risk
averse uh than the than the US Spas

7900
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:33,040
averse uh than the than the US Spas
 

7901
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:35,910
averse uh than the than the US Spas
program and there's parallels here but

7902
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:35,920
program and there's parallels here but
 

7903
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:36,870
program and there's parallels here but
you know there's probably going to be

7904
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:36,880
you know there's probably going to be
 

7905
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:39,790
you know there's probably going to be
downward pressure on that safety bar for

7906
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:39,800
downward pressure on that safety bar for
 

7907
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:41,389
downward pressure on that safety bar for
the US companies right this is something

7908
02:20:41,389 --> 02:20:41,399
the US companies right this is something
 

7909
02:20:41,399 --> 02:20:43,070
the US companies right this is something
that Dario talks about is like that's

7910
02:20:43,070 --> 02:20:43,080
that Dario talks about is like that's
 

7911
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:46,070
that Dario talks about is like that's
the situation that Dario wants to avoid

7912
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,080
the situation that Dario wants to avoid
 

7913
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:48,550
the situation that Dario wants to avoid
is Dario talks to about the difference

7914
02:20:48,550 --> 02:20:48,560
is Dario talks to about the difference
 

7915
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:49,870
is Dario talks to about the difference
between race to the bottom and race to

7916
02:20:49,870 --> 02:20:49,880
between race to the bottom and race to
 

7917
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,670
between race to the bottom and race to
the top and the race to the top is where

7918
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:51,680
the top and the race to the top is where
 

7919
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,349
the top and the race to the top is where
there's a very high standard on safety

7920
02:20:53,349 --> 02:20:53,359
there's a very high standard on safety
 

7921
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:54,630
there's a very high standard on safety
there's a very high standard on your

7922
02:20:54,630 --> 02:20:54,640
there's a very high standard on your
 

7923
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:56,630
there's a very high standard on your
model performs and certain crucial

7924
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:56,640
model performs and certain crucial
 

7925
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:58,750
model performs and certain crucial
evaluations and when certain companies

7926
02:20:58,750 --> 02:20:58,760
evaluations and when certain companies
 

7927
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:00,950
evaluations and when certain companies
are really good to it they will converge

7928
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:00,960
are really good to it they will converge
 

7929
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:04,309
are really good to it they will converge
this is the idea and ultimately AI is

7930
02:21:04,309 --> 02:21:04,319
this is the idea and ultimately AI is
 

7931
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:08,110
this is the idea and ultimately AI is
not confined to one nationality or to

02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:08,120
not confined to one nationality or to
 

7933
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:11,030
not confined to one nationality or to
one like set of morals for what it

7934
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:11,040
one like set of morals for what it
 

7935
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,630
one like set of morals for what it
should mean and there's a lot of

7936
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:12,640
should mean and there's a lot of
 

7937
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,950
should mean and there's a lot of
arguments on like should we stop open

7938
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:14,960
arguments on like should we stop open
 

7939
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:18,110
arguments on like should we stop open
sourcing models and if the US stops it's

7940
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:18,120
sourcing models and if the US stops it's
 

7941
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:20,030
sourcing models and if the US stops it's
pretty clear I mean it's way easier to

7942
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:20,040
pretty clear I mean it's way easier to
 

7943
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,190
pretty clear I mean it's way easier to

02:21:29,790 --> 02:21:29,800
million dollar number think about how
 

7953
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:31,550
million dollar number think about how
many entities in the world can afford a

02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:35,560
source model that people use in the
 

7959
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:39,270
source model that people use in the
world and it's like it's a scary reality

7960
02:21:39,270 --> 02:21:39,280
world and it's like it's a scary reality
 

7961
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:41,270
world and it's like it's a scary reality
which is that these open models are

7962
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:41,280
which is that these open models are
 

7963
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:42,990
which is that these open models are
probably going to keep coming for the

7964
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:43,000
probably going to keep coming for the
 

7965
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,550
probably going to keep coming for the
time being whether or not we want to

7966
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,560
time being whether or not we want to
 

7967
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:47,349
time being whether or not we want to
stop them and it is like stopping them

7968
02:21:47,349 --> 02:21:47,359
stop them and it is like stopping them
 

7969
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:49,030
stop them and it is like stopping them
might make it even worse and harder to

02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:49,040
might make it even worse and harder to
 

7971
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,070
might make it even worse and harder to
prepare but it just means that the

7972
02:21:51,070 --> 02:21:51,080
prepare but it just means that the
 

7973
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,710
prepare but it just means that the
preparation and understanding what AI

7974
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:52,720
preparation and understanding what AI
 

7975
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:54,910
preparation and understanding what AI
can do is just so much more

7976
02:21:54,910 --> 02:21:54,920
can do is just so much more
 

7977
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:57,790
can do is just so much more
important that's why I'm here at the end

7978
02:21:57,790 --> 02:21:57,800
important that's why I'm here at the end
 

7979
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:59,750
important that's why I'm here at the end
of the day but it's like letting that

7980
02:21:59,750 --> 02:21:59,760
of the day but it's like letting that
 

7981
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:02,150
of the day but it's like letting that
sink into people especially not in AI is

7982
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:02,160
sink into people especially not in AI is
 

7983
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:04,469
sink into people especially not in AI is
that like this is coming there are some

7984
02:22:04,469 --> 02:22:04,479
that like this is coming there are some
 

7985
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:06,590
that like this is coming there are some
structural things in a global

7986
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:06,600
structural things in a global
 

7987
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:08,630
structural things in a global
interconnected world that you have to

7988
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:08,640
interconnected world that you have to
 

7989
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:11,830
interconnected world that you have to
accept Yeah you mentioned uh you sent me

7990
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:11,840
accept Yeah you mentioned uh you sent me

something that Zuck Mark Zucker Brook

7992
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:13,600
something that Zuck Mark Zucker Brook
 

7993
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:16,309
something that Zuck Mark Zucker Brook
mentioned on earnings call he said that

7994
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:16,319
mentioned on earnings call he said that
 

7995
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:17,710
mentioned on earnings call he said that
I think in light of some of the recent

7996
02:22:17,710 --> 02:22:17,720
I think in light of some of the recent
 

7997
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,830
I think in light of some of the recent
news the new competitor deep seek from

7998
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:19,840
news the new competitor deep seek from
 

7999
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:21,630
news the new competitor deep seek from
China I think it's one of the things

8000
02:22:21,630 --> 02:22:21,640
China I think it's one of the things
 

8001
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,030
China I think it's one of the things
that we're talking about is there's

8002
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:23,040
that we're talking about is there's
 

8003
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:24,389
that we're talking about is there's
going to be an open source standard

8004
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:24,399
going to be an open source standard
 

8005
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,950
going to be an open source standard
globally and I think for our kind of

8006
02:22:26,950 --> 02:22:26,960
globally and I think for our kind of
 

8007
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:28,469
globally and I think for our kind of
national Advantage it's important that

8008
02:22:28,469 --> 02:22:28,479
national Advantage it's important that
 

8009
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:31,030
national Advantage it's important that
it's an American Standard so we take

8010
02:22:31,030 --> 02:22:31,040
it's an American Standard so we take
 

8011
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,150
it's an American Standard so we take
that seriously we want to build the AI

8012
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:33,160
that seriously we want to build the AI
 

8013
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:34,469
that seriously we want to build the AI
system that people around the world are

8014
02:22:34,469 --> 02:22:34,479
system that people around the world are
 

8015
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:36,990
system that people around the world are
using and I think that if any think some

8016
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:37,000
using and I think that if any think some
 

8017
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,670
using and I think that if any think some
of the recent news has only strengthened

8018
02:22:38,670 --> 02:22:38,680
of the recent news has only strengthened
 

8019
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:40,550
of the recent news has only strengthened
our conviction that this is the right

8020
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:40,560
our conviction that this is the right
 

8021
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,230
our conviction that this is the right
thing to be focused on so yeah open

8022
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:42,240
thing to be focused on so yeah open
 

8023
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,469
thing to be focused on so yeah open
sourcing yeah Mark Zuckerberg is not new

8024
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
sourcing yeah Mark Zuckerberg is not new
 

8025
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:47,790
sourcing yeah Mark Zuckerberg is not new
to having uh American values and how he

8026
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:47,800

02:22:54,429 --> 02:22:54,439
China and I I respect the saying it
 

8033
02:22:54,439 --> 02:22:56,429
China and I I respect the saying it
directly and and there's an interesting

8034
02:22:56,429 --> 02:22:56,439
directly and and there's an interesting
 

8035
02:22:56,439 --> 02:22:58,790
directly and and there's an interesting
aspect of just because it's open weights

8036
02:22:58,790 --> 02:22:58,800
aspect of just because it's open weights
 

8037
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,030
aspect of just because it's open weights
or open source doesn't mean it can't be

open- Source software bugs that have

8042
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:05,160
open- Source software bugs that have
 

8043
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,030
open- Source software bugs that have
been like uh you know for example there

8044
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:07,040
been like uh you know for example there
 

8045
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:08,830
been like uh you know for example there
was a Linux bug that was found after

8046
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:08,840
was a Linux bug that was found after
 

8047
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:10,510
was a Linux bug that was found after
like 10 years which was clearly a back

8048
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:10,520
like 10 years which was clearly a back
 

8049
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,870
like 10 years which was clearly a back
door uh because somebody was like why is

8050
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:12,880
door uh because somebody was like why is
 

8051
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:15,030
door uh because somebody was like why is
this taking uh you know half a second

8052
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:15,040
this taking uh you know half a second
 

8053
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:16,389
this taking uh you know half a second
recent one right like there why is it

8054
02:23:16,389 --> 02:23:16,399
recent one right like there why is it
 

8055
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:17,710
recent one right like there why is it
taking half a second to load and it was

8056
02:23:17,710 --> 02:23:17,720
taking half a second to load and it was
 

8057
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:19,550
taking half a second to load and it was
like oh crap there's a back door here

8058
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:19,560
like oh crap there's a back door here
 

8059
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:21,990
like oh crap there's a back door here
that's why right it's like this is very

8060
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,000
that's why right it's like this is very
 

8061
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,990
that's why right it's like this is very
much possible with AI models right um

8062
02:23:24,990 --> 02:23:25,000
much possible with AI models right um
 

8063
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,389
much possible with AI models right um

02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:03,550
that's open weights this can then
proliferate right but as these systems

different encryption than nist defines
 

8191
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:34,670

8195
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:38,150
least they think there's back doors in
it right um what happens when the models

8196
02:25:38,150 --> 02:25:38,160
it right um what happens when the models
 

8197
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:40,590
it right um what happens when the models
are back doors not just to computer

8198
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:40,600
are back doors not just to computer
 

8199
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,150
are back doors not just to computer
systems but to our minds yeah they're

8200
02:25:42,150 --> 02:25:42,160
systems but to our minds yeah they're
 

8201
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:45,309
systems but to our minds yeah they're
cultural back doors I the thing that

8202
02:25:45,309 --> 02:25:45,319
cultural back doors I the thing that
 

8203
02:25:45,319 --> 02:25:47,190
cultural back doors I the thing that
amplifies the relevance of culture with

02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:49,800
language models is that we are used to
 

8207
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:53,830

this mode of interacting with people in
 

8209
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:55,870
this mode of interacting with people in
back and forth conversation and we have

back and forth conversation and we have
 

8211
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,750

this is an actual concern with a Chinese
 

8225
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:17,510
this is an actual concern with a Chinese
company that is providing open weights

8226
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:17,520
company that is providing open weights
 

8227
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,469
company that is providing open weights
models is that there could be some

8228
02:26:19,469 --> 02:26:19,479
models is that there could be some
 

8229
02:26:19,479 --> 02:26:22,750

Secret Chinese government sort of

8230
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:22,760
Secret Chinese government sort of
 

8231
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:24,990
Secret Chinese government sort of
requirement for these models to have a

8232
02:26:24,990 --> 02:26:25,000
requirement for these models to have a
 

8233
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,269
requirement for these models to have a
certain kind of back door to have some

8234
02:26:27,269 --> 02:26:27,279
certain kind of back door to have some
 

8235
02:26:27,279 --> 02:26:28,910
certain kind of back door to have some
kind of thing where I don't necessarily

8236
02:26:28,910 --> 02:26:28,920
kind of thing where I don't necessarily
 

8237
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:30,349
kind of thing where I don't necessarily
think it'll be a back door right because

8238
02:26:30,349 --> 02:26:30,359
think it'll be a back door right because
 

8239
02:26:30,359 --> 02:26:31,710
think it'll be a back door right because
once it's open weights it doesn't like

8240
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:31,720
once it's open weights it doesn't like

once it's open weights it doesn't like
phone home it's more about like if it

8242
02:26:34,429 --> 02:26:34,439
phone home it's more about like if it
 

8243
02:26:34,439 --> 02:26:36,910
phone home it's more about like if it
recognizes a certain system it could

8244
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:36,920
recognizes a certain system it could
 

8245
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:38,469
recognizes a certain system it could
like if if now now it could be a back

8246
02:26:38,469 --> 02:26:38,479
like if if now now it could be a back
 

8247
02:26:38,479 --> 02:26:39,790
like if if now now it could be a back
door in the sense of like hey if you're

8248
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:39,800
door in the sense of like hey if you're
 

8249
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:41,670
door in the sense of like hey if you're
building a software uh you know

02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:17,910
before we get this AGI ASI stuff we can
embed superhuman persuasion towards our

embed superhuman persuasion towards our
 

8337

ideal or whatever the ideal of the model
 

8339
02:28:20,439 --> 02:28:22,349
ideal or whatever the ideal of the model
is right and again like today I truly

8340
02:28:22,349 --> 02:28:22,359
is right and again like today I truly
 

8341
02:28:22,359 --> 02:28:24,150
is right and again like today I truly
don't believe deep seek has done this

8342
02:28:24,150 --> 02:28:24,160
don't believe deep seek has done this
 

8343
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:26,269
don't believe deep seek has done this
right like but it is a sign of like what

8344
02:28:26,269 --> 02:28:26,279
right like but it is a sign of like what
 

8345
02:28:26,279 --> 02:28:28,309
right like but it is a sign of like what
could happen so one of the dystopian

8346
02:28:28,309 --> 02:28:28,319
could happen so one of the dystopian
 

8347
02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:30,750
could happen so one of the dystopian
worlds is uh described by Brave New

8348
02:28:30,750 --> 02:28:30,760
worlds is uh described by Brave New
 

8349
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:32,670
worlds is uh described by Brave New
World so we could just be stuck

8350
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:32,680
World so we could just be stuck
 

8351
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:35,309
World so we could just be stuck

02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:40,960
bots that are giving us a narrative and
 

8357
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:42,870
bots that are giving us a narrative and
we completely get lost in that world

8358
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:42,880
we completely get lost in that world
 

8359
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:45,309
we completely get lost in that world
that's controlled by somebody else but

8360
02:28:45,309 --> 02:28:45,319
that's controlled by somebody else but
 

8361
02:28:45,319 --> 02:28:47,190
that's controlled by somebody else but
versus thinking independently and that's

8362
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:47,200
versus thinking independently and that's
 

8363
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,670
versus thinking independently and that's
that's that's a major concern as we rely

8364
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:49,680
that's that's a major concern as we rely
 

8365
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,670
that's that's a major concern as we rely
more more on these kinds of systems I

8366
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:51,680
more more on these kinds of systems I
 

8367
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:52,870
more more on these kinds of systems I
mean we've already seen this with

8368
02:28:52,870 --> 02:28:52,880
mean we've already seen this with
 

8369
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:54,190
mean we've already seen this with
recommendation systems yeah

8370
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:54,200
recommendation systems yeah
 

8371
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:56,110
recommendation systems yeah
recommendation systems hack the the

8372
02:28:56,110 --> 02:28:56,120
recommendation systems hack the the
 

8373
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:58,070
recommendation systems hack the the
dopamine induced reward circuit but the

8374
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:58,080
dopamine induced reward circuit but the
 

8375
02:28:58,080 --> 02:28:59,870
dopamine induced reward circuit but the
brain is a lot more complicated and what

8376

brain is a lot more complicated and what
 

8377
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:01,750

02:29:03,150 --> 02:29:03,160
feedback loops in your brain can you
 

8381
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:06,150
feedback loops in your brain can you
hack slash uh subvert in ways like

8382
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:06,160
hack slash uh subvert in ways like
 

8383
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:07,950
hack slash uh subvert in ways like

8393
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,750
complicated models there's no reason in
some number of years that you can't

02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:18,760
some number of years that you can't

8397
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:24,110

spent on a chat app like right now they

8398
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:24,120
spent on a chat app like right now they
 

8399
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:25,389

are trained I mean is that not what

02:29:25,389 --> 02:29:25,399
are trained I mean is that not what

character AI has done their time per
 

8403
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:29,110
character AI has done their time per

8411
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:36,110
way that this data is collected is naive
where it's like you're presented a few

where it's like you're presented a few
 

8413
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:38,150
where it's like you're presented a few

02:29:38,150 --> 02:29:38,160
options and you choose them but there's
 

8415
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:39,550

that's not the only way that these

that's not the only way that these

naive stuff like talk to an anime girl

8420
02:29:42,309 --> 02:29:42,319
naive stuff like talk to an anime girl
 

8421
02:29:42,319 --> 02:29:44,910
naive stuff like talk to an anime girl
but like it can be like yeah this is a

8422
02:29:44,910 --> 02:29:44,920
but like it can be like yeah this is a
 

8423
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:46,710
but like it can be like yeah this is a
risk right like it's it's a bit of a

8424
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:46,720
risk right like it's it's a bit of a
 

8425
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:50,110
risk right like it's it's a bit of a
cliche thing to say but I've uh over the

8426
02:29:50,110 --> 02:29:50,120
cliche thing to say but I've uh over the
 

8427
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:52,230
cliche thing to say but I've uh over the
past year had a few stretches of time

8428
02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:52,240
past year had a few stretches of time
 

8429
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:54,429
past year had a few stretches of time
where I didn't use social media or the

8430
02:29:54,429 --> 02:29:54,439
where I didn't use social media or the
 

8431
02:29:54,439 --> 02:29:56,990
where I didn't use social media or the
internet at all and just read books and

8432
02:29:56,990 --> 02:29:57,000
internet at all and just read books and
 

8433
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,670
internet at all and just read books and
was out in nature and it like it clearly

8434
02:29:59,670 --> 02:29:59,680
was out in nature and it like it clearly
 

8435
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:02,429
was out in nature and it like it clearly
has a an effect on the Mind where like

8436
02:30:02,429 --> 02:30:02,439
has a an effect on the Mind where like
 

8437
02:30:02,439 --> 02:30:05,150
has a an effect on the Mind where like
it change like I feel like I'm returning

of course I was uh raised before the
 

8441
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:09,030
of course I was uh raised before the
internet really took off but I'm

8442
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:09,040
internet really took off but I'm
 

8443
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,830
internet really took off but I'm
returning to some

8444
02:30:10,830 --> 02:30:10,840
returning to some
 

8445
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:12,710
returning to some
more I know where you're going I mean

8446
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:12,720
more I know where you're going I mean
 

8447
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:14,910
more I know where you're going I mean
you can see it physiologically like I

8448
02:30:14,910 --> 02:30:14,920
you can see it physiologically like I
 

8449
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:16,710
you can see it physiologically like I
take three days if I'm like backpacking

8450
02:30:16,710 --> 02:30:16,720
take three days if I'm like backpacking
 

8451
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:20,550
take three days if I'm like backpacking
or something and you you're you're like

8452
02:30:20,550 --> 02:30:20,560
or something and you you're you're like
 

8453
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:22,750
or something and you you're you're like
you're breaking down addiction Cycles I

8454
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:22,760
you're breaking down addiction Cycles I
 

8455
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:25,269
you're breaking down addiction Cycles I
feel like I'm more in control of my mind

8456
02:30:25,269 --> 02:30:25,279
feel like I'm more in control of my mind
 

8457
02:30:25,279 --> 02:30:27,510
feel like I'm more in control of my mind
there feels like a sovereignty of

8458
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:27,520
there feels like a sovereignty of
 

8459
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:29,190
there feels like a sovereignty of
intelligence that's happening when I'm

8460
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,200
intelligence that's happening when I'm
 

8461
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,389
intelligence that's happening when I'm
disconnected from the internet I think

8462
02:30:31,389 --> 02:30:31,399
disconnected from the internet I think
 

8463
02:30:31,399 --> 02:30:33,710
disconnected from the internet I think
um the more I use the the internet and

8464
02:30:33,710 --> 02:30:33,720
um the more I use the the internet and
 

8465
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,349
um the more I use the the internet and
social media the more other people are

8466
02:30:35,349 --> 02:30:35,359
social media the more other people are
 

8467
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:37,269
social media the more other people are
controlling my mind that's definitely a

8468
02:30:37,269 --> 02:30:37,279
controlling my mind that's definitely a
 

8469
02:30:37,279 --> 02:30:39,670
controlling my mind that's definitely a
feeling and then in the future that will

8470
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:39,680
feeling and then in the future that will
 

8471
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:42,349
feeling and then in the future that will
be not other people but algorithms or

8472
02:30:42,349 --> 02:30:42,359
be not other people but algorithms or
 

8473
02:30:42,359 --> 02:30:44,590
be not other people but algorithms or
other people presented to me via

8474
02:30:44,590 --> 02:30:44,600
other people presented to me via
 

8475
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:46,110
other people presented to me via
algorithms there I mean there are

8476
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:46,120
algorithms there I mean there are
 

8477
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:48,230
algorithms there I mean there are
already tons of AI bots on the internet

8478
02:30:48,230 --> 02:30:48,240
already tons of AI bots on the internet
 

8479
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:49,950
already tons of AI bots on the internet
and every so right now it's not frequent

8480
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:49,960
and every so right now it's not frequent
 

8481
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:52,269
and every so right now it's not frequent
but every so often I have replied to one

8482
02:30:52,269 --> 02:30:52,279
but every so often I have replied to one
 

8483
02:30:52,279 --> 02:30:53,670
but every so often I have replied to one
and there instantly replies I'm like

8484
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:53,680
and there instantly replies I'm like
 

8485
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:55,630
and there instantly replies I'm like
crap that was a bot and that is just

8486
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:55,640
crap that was a bot and that is just
 

8487
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:57,870
crap that was a bot and that is just
going to become more common like they're

02:31:40,150 --> 02:31:40,160
this for these creators and do it like
 

8531
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:41,950
this for these creators and do it like
on a like Mass scale so the largest

02:31:49,870 --> 02:31:49,880
a time because of these Bots and so it's
 

8539
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:52,030
a time because of these Bots and so it's
it's already being used there obviously

8547
02:31:56,479 --> 02:31:59,469
it's going to come to the rest of
society too there's a general concern

society too there's a general concern
 

8549
02:31:59,479 --> 02:32:01,070
society too there's a general concern
that models get censored by the

8550
02:32:01,070 --> 02:32:01,080
that models get censored by the
 

8551
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:04,750
that models get censored by the
companies that deploy them so one case

8552
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:04,760
companies that deploy them so one case
 

8553
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:06,349
companies that deploy them so one case
when we've seen that and maybe

8554
02:32:06,349 --> 02:32:06,359
when we've seen that and maybe
 

8555
02:32:06,359 --> 02:32:08,950
when we've seen that and maybe
censorship is one word

8556
02:32:08,950 --> 02:32:08,960
censorship is one word
 

8557
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:12,510

alignment maybe via rhf or some other

8558
02:32:12,510 --> 02:32:12,520
alignment maybe via rhf or some other
 

8559
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:15,389
alignment maybe via rhf or some other
way is another word so that we we saw

8560
02:32:15,389 --> 02:32:15,399
way is another word so that we we saw
 

8561
02:32:15,399 --> 02:32:17,950
way is another word so that we we saw
that with black Nazi image generation

8562

with uh Gemini
 

8565
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:23,429
with uh Gemini
uh as you mentioned we also see that uh

Square so how can this be avoided and

8574
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:33,600
Square so how can this be avoided and
 

8575
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:36,150
Square so how can this be avoided and
maybe can you just in general talk about

8576
02:32:36,150 --> 02:32:36,160
maybe can you just in general talk about
 

8577
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:38,150
maybe can you just in general talk about
how this happens and how can it be

8578
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:38,160
how this happens and how can it be
 

8579
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:41,870
how this happens and how can it be
avoided you give multiple examples um

8580
02:32:41,870 --> 02:32:41,880
avoided you give multiple examples um
 

8581
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:43,630
avoided you give multiple examples um
there's

8582
02:32:43,630 --> 02:32:43,640
there's
 

8583
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,910
there's
probably a few things to keep in mind

8584
02:32:45,910 --> 02:32:45,920
probably a few things to keep in mind
 

8585
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:49,309
probably a few things to keep in mind
here one is the kind of tanaman square

8586
02:32:49,309 --> 02:32:49,319
here one is the kind of tanaman square
 

8587
02:32:49,319 --> 02:32:51,830
here one is the kind of tanaman square
factual knowledge like did thing like

8588
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:51,840
factual knowledge like did thing like
 

8589
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:53,510
factual knowledge like did thing like
how does that get embedded into the

8590
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:53,520
how does that get embedded into the
 

8591
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:57,150
how does that get embedded into the
models two is the Gemini what you call

8592
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:57,160
models two is the Gemini what you call
 

8593
02:32:57,160 --> 02:32:59,790
models two is the Gemini what you call
the black Nazi incident which is when

8594
02:32:59,790 --> 02:32:59,800
the black Nazi incident which is when
 

8595
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:02,750
the black Nazi incident which is when
Gemini as a system had this extra thing

8596
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:02,760
Gemini as a system had this extra thing
 

8597
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:04,469
Gemini as a system had this extra thing
put into it that dramatically changed

8598
02:33:04,469 --> 02:33:04,479
put into it that dramatically changed
 

8599
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:07,349
put into it that dramatically changed
the behavior and then three is what most

8600
02:33:07,349 --> 02:33:07,359
the behavior and then three is what most
 

8601
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:10,070
the behavior and then three is what most
people would call General alignment rhf

8602
02:33:10,070 --> 02:33:10,080
people would call General alignment rhf
 

8603
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:13,110
people would call General alignment rhf
post training um each of these have very

8604
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,120
post training um each of these have very
 

8605
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:14,750
post training um each of these have very
different Scopes and how they are

8606
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:14,760
different Scopes and how they are
 

8607
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:17,030
different Scopes and how they are
applied in order to do if you're just

8608
02:33:17,030 --> 02:33:17,040
applied in order to do if you're just
 

8609
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,309
applied in order to do if you're just
look at the model weights in order to

8610
02:33:19,309 --> 02:33:19,319
look at the model weights in order to
 

8611
02:33:19,319 --> 02:33:22,790
look at the model weights in order to
audit specific facts is extremely hard

8612
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:22,800
audit specific facts is extremely hard
 

8613
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:24,150
audit specific facts is extremely hard
because you have to Chrome through the

8614
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:24,160
because you have to Chrome through the
 

8615
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:26,349
because you have to Chrome through the
pre-training data and look at all of

8616
02:33:26,349 --> 02:33:26,359
pre-training data and look at all of
 

8617
02:33:26,359 --> 02:33:29,389
pre-training data and look at all of
this and then that's terabytes of files

8618
02:33:29,389 --> 02:33:29,399
this and then that's terabytes of files
 

8619
02:33:29,399 --> 02:33:31,429
this and then that's terabytes of files
and look for very specific words or

8620
02:33:31,429 --> 02:33:31,439
and look for very specific words or
 

8621
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:33,349
and look for very specific words or
hints of the words so I I guess one way

8622
02:33:33,349 --> 02:33:33,359
hints of the words so I I guess one way
 

8623
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:35,110
hints of the words so I I guess one way
to say it is that you can insert

8624
02:33:35,110 --> 02:33:35,120
to say it is that you can insert
 

8625
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:37,309
to say it is that you can insert
censorship or alignment at various

8626
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:37,319
censorship or alignment at various
 

8627
02:33:37,319 --> 02:33:38,910
censorship or alignment at various
stages in the pipeline and what you

8628
02:33:38,910 --> 02:33:38,920
stages in the pipeline and what you
 

8629
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:40,950
stages in the pipeline and what you
refer to now is at the very beginning of

8630
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:40,960
refer to now is at the very beginning of
 

8631
02:33:40,960 --> 02:33:42,910
refer to now is at the very beginning of
the data select so if you want to get

8632
02:33:42,910 --> 02:33:42,920
the data select so if you want to get
 

8633
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:45,230
the data select so if you want to get
rid of facts in a model you have to do

8634
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:45,240
rid of facts in a model you have to do
 

8635
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:46,950
rid of facts in a model you have to do
it at every stage you have to do it at

8636
02:33:46,950 --> 02:33:46,960
it at every stage you have to do it at
 

8637
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:48,429
it at every stage you have to do it at
the pre-training so most people think

8638
02:33:48,429 --> 02:33:48,439
the pre-training so most people think
 

8639
02:33:48,439 --> 02:33:50,590
the pre-training so most people think
that pre-training is where most of the

8640
02:33:50,590 --> 02:33:50,600
that pre-training is where most of the
 

8641
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:52,349
that pre-training is where most of the
knowledge is put into the model and then

8642
02:33:52,349 --> 02:33:52,359
knowledge is put into the model and then
 

8643
02:33:52,359 --> 02:33:54,990
knowledge is put into the model and then
you can elicit and move that in

just have a slight left bias right

8710
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:06,040
just have a slight left bias right
 

8711
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:08,630
just have a slight left bias right
because it's always been richer more

8712
02:35:08,630 --> 02:35:08,640
because it's always been richer more

affluent uh younger people on the

02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:10,760

internet relative to the rest of the
 

8717
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:14,269
internet relative to the rest of the
population so there is already

8718
02:35:14,269 --> 02:35:14,279
population so there is already
 

8719
02:35:14,279 --> 02:35:16,630
population so there is already
inherently a slight left bias right on

inherently a slight left bias right on
 

8721
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:18,429
inherently a slight left bias right on
the internet and so how do you filter

8722
02:35:18,429 --> 02:35:18,439
the internet and so how do you filter
 

8723
02:35:18,439 --> 02:35:19,990
the internet and so how do you filter
things that are this complicated right

8724
02:35:19,990 --> 02:35:20,000
things that are this complicated right
 

8725
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,750
things that are this complicated right
is it like and and some of these can be

8726
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:21,760
is it like and and some of these can be
 

8727
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,990
is it like and and some of these can be
like you know factual non-factual but

8728
02:35:23,990 --> 02:35:24,000
like you know factual non-factual but
 

8729
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,550
like you know factual non-factual but
like tan square is obviously the example

8730
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:25,560
like tan square is obviously the example
 

8731
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:27,190
like tan square is obviously the example
of a factual but it gets a lot harder

8732
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,200
of a factual but it gets a lot harder
 

8733
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:29,510
of a factual but it gets a lot harder
when you're talking about aligning to a

8734
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:29,520
when you're talking about aligning to a
 

8735
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:33,710
when you're talking about aligning to a
ideal right um which yeah and so grock

8736
02:35:33,710 --> 02:35:33,720
ideal right um which yeah and so grock
 

8737
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:35,269
ideal right um which yeah and so grock
for example right elon's tried really

8738
02:35:35,269 --> 02:35:35,279
for example right elon's tried really
 

8739
02:35:35,279 --> 02:35:37,790
for example right elon's tried really
hard to make the model not be super PC

8740
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:37,800
hard to make the model not be super PC
 

8741
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:40,230
hard to make the model not be super PC
and woke but the best way to do

8742
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:40,240
and woke but the best way to do
 

8743
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:41,870
and woke but the best way to do
pre-training is to throw the whole

8744
02:35:41,870 --> 02:35:41,880
pre-training is to throw the whole
 

8745
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:43,389
pre-training is to throw the whole

8747
02:35:43,399 --> 02:35:44,910
freaking internet at it right and then
later figure out but then at the end of

8748
02:35:44,910 --> 02:35:44,920
later figure out but then at the end of
 

8749
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:46,750
later figure out but then at the end of
the day the model at its core now still

02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:46,760
the day the model at its core now still
 

8751
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:48,590
the day the model at its core now still
has some of these ideals right you still

8752
02:35:48,590 --> 02:35:48,600
has some of these ideals right you still

you try really really really really

a really specific behavior uh and I mean
 

8791
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:29,870
a really specific behavior uh and I mean
it's it's like you can you also have the

02:36:29,870 --> 02:36:29,880
it's it's like you can you also have the
 

8793

9139
02:42:37,279 --> 02:42:38,990

Industry like constitutional AI where
you use human data for preferences and

you use human data for preferences and
 

9173
02:43:13,399 --> 02:43:15,710
you use human data for preferences and
AI for preferences and I expect the AI

9174
02:43:15,710 --> 02:43:15,720

02:43:19,910 --> 02:43:19,920
but among the research that we have
 

9179
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:23,469
but among the research that we have
access to is that it humans are in this

reasoning becomes bigger and bigger and

9184
02:43:27,750 --> 02:43:27,760
reasoning becomes bigger and bigger and
 

9185
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:29,950
reasoning becomes bigger and bigger and
bigger as we said where's the role of

9186
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:29,960
bigger as we said where's the role of
 

9187
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:33,070
bigger as we said where's the role of
humans in that it's even less prevalent

02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:33,080
humans in that it's even less prevalent
 

9189
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:35,830
humans in that it's even less prevalent
so it's the remarkable thing about these

9190
02:43:35,830 --> 02:43:35,840
so it's the remarkable thing about these
 

9191
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:37,429
so it's the remarkable thing about these
reasoning results and especially the

9192
02:43:37,429 --> 02:43:37,439
reasoning results and especially the
 

9193
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:39,710
reasoning results and especially the
Deep seek R1 paper is this result that

9194
02:43:39,710 --> 02:43:39,720
Deep seek R1 paper is this result that
 

9195
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:42,030
Deep seek R1 paper is this result that
they call Deep seek r10 which is they

9196
02:43:42,030 --> 02:43:42,040
they call Deep seek r10 which is they
 

9197
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:43,510
they call Deep seek r10 which is they
took one of these pre-trained models

9198
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:43,520
took one of these pre-trained models
 

9199
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:45,830
took one of these pre-trained models
they took deep seek V3 base and then

9200
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:45,840
they took deep seek V3 base and then
 

9201
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,710
they took deep seek V3 base and then
they do this reinforcement learning

9202
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:47,720
they do this reinforcement learning
 

9203
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:49,990
they do this reinforcement learning
optimization on verifi able questions or

9204
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,000

9207
02:43:52,439 --> 02:43:54,349
verifiable rewards for a lot of

9208
02:43:54,349 --> 02:43:54,359
questions and a lot of training and
 

9209
02:43:54,359 --> 02:43:56,030
questions and a lot of training and
these reasoning behaviors emerge

9210
02:43:56,030 --> 02:43:56,040
these reasoning behaviors emerge
 

9211
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:57,750
these reasoning behaviors emerge
naturally so these things like wait let

9212
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:57,760
naturally so these things like wait let

might be a mistake and they emerge from

9216
02:44:03,070 --> 02:44:03,080
might be a mistake and they emerge from
 

9217
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:05,429
might be a mistake and they emerge from
only having questions and answers and

9218
02:44:05,429 --> 02:44:05,439
only having questions and answers and
 

9219
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:06,870
only having questions and answers and
when you're using the model the part

9220
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:06,880
when you're using the model the part
 

9221
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:08,950
when you're using the model the part
that you look at is the completion so in

9222
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:08,960
that you look at is the completion so in
 

9223
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:11,510
that you look at is the completion so in
this case all of that just emerges from

9224
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:11,520
this case all of that just emerges from
 

9225
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,190
this case all of that just emerges from
this large scale RL

this rhf after the reasoning stage but

9238
02:44:27,990 --> 02:44:28,000
this rhf after the reasoning stage but
 

9239
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,510
this rhf after the reasoning stage but
the very remarkable thing is that you

9240
02:44:29,510 --> 02:44:29,520
the very remarkable thing is that you
 

9241
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:31,910
the very remarkable thing is that you
can get these reasoning behaviors and

9242
02:44:31,910 --> 02:44:31,920
can get these reasoning behaviors and
 

9243
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,590
can get these reasoning behaviors and
it's very unlikely that there's humans

9244
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:33,600
it's very unlikely that there's humans
 

9245
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:35,389
it's very unlikely that there's humans
writing out reasoning Chains It's very

9246
02:44:35,389 --> 02:44:35,399
writing out reasoning Chains It's very
 

9247
02:44:35,399 --> 02:44:37,070
writing out reasoning Chains It's very
unlikely that they somehow hacked open

9248
02:44:37,070 --> 02:44:37,080
unlikely that they somehow hacked open
 

9249
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,510
unlikely that they somehow hacked open
Ai and they got access to open a1's

9250
02:44:39,510 --> 02:44:39,520
Ai and they got access to open a1's
 

9251
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:42,110
Ai and they got access to open a1's
reasoning chains it's something about

9252
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:42,120
reasoning chains it's something about
 

9253
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:44,190
reasoning chains it's something about
the pre-trained language models and this

9254
02:44:44,190 --> 02:44:44,200
the pre-trained language models and this
 

9255
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:46,190
the pre-trained language models and this
RL training where you reward the model

9256
02:44:46,190 --> 02:44:46,200
RL training where you reward the model
 

9257
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:48,190
RL training where you reward the model
for getting the question right and

9258
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:48,200
for getting the question right and
 

9259
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:49,910
for getting the question right and
therefore it's triang multiple Solutions

9260
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:49,920
therefore it's triang multiple Solutions
 

9261
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:52,870
therefore it's triang multiple Solutions
and it it emerges this Chain of Thought

9262
02:44:52,870 --> 02:44:52,880

started to get better and better at
 

9537
02:50:05,239 --> 02:50:07,070
started to get better and better at
these uh benchmarks and so you've seen

9538
02:50:07,070 --> 02:50:07,080
these uh benchmarks and so you've seen
 

9539
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:09,309
these uh benchmarks and so you've seen
over the last six months a skyrocketing

9540
02:50:09,309 --> 02:50:09,319
over the last six months a skyrocketing
 

9541
02:50:09,319 --> 02:50:11,349
over the last six months a skyrocketing
in a lot of different benchmarks right

02:50:11,349 --> 02:50:11,359
in a lot of different benchmarks right
 

9543
02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:13,030
in a lot of different benchmarks right
all math and code benchmarks are pretty

9544
02:50:13,030 --> 02:50:13,040
all math and code benchmarks are pretty
 

9545
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:14,910
all math and code benchmarks are pretty
much solved except for Frontier math

9546
02:50:14,910 --> 02:50:14,920
much solved except for Frontier math
 

9547
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:17,389
much solved except for Frontier math
which is designed to be almost questions

9548
02:50:17,389 --> 02:50:17,399
which is designed to be almost questions
 

9549
02:50:17,399 --> 02:50:19,190
which is designed to be almost questions
that aren't practical to most people cuz

9550
02:50:19,190 --> 02:50:19,200
that aren't practical to most people cuz
 

9551
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:23,349
that aren't practical to most people cuz
they're like their exam level open math

9552
02:50:23,349 --> 02:50:23,359
they're like their exam level open math
 

9553
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:25,990
they're like their exam level open math
problem type things so it's like on the

9554
02:50:25,990 --> 02:50:26,000
problem type things so it's like on the
 

9555
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,190
problem type things so it's like on the
math problems that are somewhat

9556
02:50:27,190 --> 02:50:27,200
math problems that are somewhat
 

9557
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:28,510
math problems that are somewhat
reasonable which is like somewhat

9558
02:50:28,510 --> 02:50:28,520
reasonable which is like somewhat
 

9559
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:30,349
reasonable which is like somewhat
complicated word problems or coding

9560
02:50:30,349 --> 02:50:30,359
complicated word problems or coding
 

9561
02:50:30,359 --> 02:50:32,670
complicated word problems or coding
problems it's just what Dylan is saying

9562
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:32,680
problems it's just what Dylan is saying
 

9563
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:35,269
problems it's just what Dylan is saying
so so the thing here is that these are

9564
02:50:35,269 --> 02:50:35,279
so so the thing here is that these are
 

9565
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:37,190
so so the thing here is that these are
only with verifiable task you we earlier

02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,150
only with verifiable task you we earlier
showed an example of the you know the

9568
02:50:39,150 --> 02:50:39,160
showed an example of the you know the
 

9569
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:40,389
showed an example of the you know the
really interesting like what happens

9570
02:50:40,389 --> 02:50:40,399
really interesting like what happens
 

9571
02:50:40,399 --> 02:50:42,190
really interesting like what happens
when chain athus to a non-verifiable

9572

when chain athus to a non-verifiable
 

9573
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:43,950
when chain athus to a non-verifiable

9579
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:49,510
thinking about what's novel for humans
right a unique thought uh but this task

9580
02:50:49,510 --> 02:50:49,520
right a unique thought uh but this task
 

9581
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:51,150
right a unique thought uh but this task
and form of training only works when

it's INF when it's verifiable um and

9584
02:50:53,550 --> 02:50:53,560
it's INF when it's verifiable um and
 

9585
02:50:53,560 --> 02:50:55,830
it's INF when it's verifiable um and
from here the thought is okay we can

9586
02:50:55,830 --> 02:50:55,840
from here the thought is okay we can
 

9587
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,750
from here the thought is okay we can

right like you know there's a whole

9666
02:52:11,389 --> 02:52:11,399
right like you know there's a whole
 

9667
02:52:11,399 --> 02:52:13,950
right like you know there's a whole
trajectory to speedrun or you know what

02:52:13,960 --> 02:52:16,990
trajectory to speedrun or you know what
models can do but at some point I truly

9670
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:17,000
models can do but at some point I truly
 

9671
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,389
models can do but at some point I truly
think that like you know we spawn models

9672
02:52:19,389 --> 02:52:19,399
think that like you know we spawn models
 

9673
02:52:19,399 --> 02:52:20,550
think that like you know we spawn models
and initially all the training will be

02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:22,429
and initially all the training will be
in sandboxes but then at some point you

9676
02:52:22,429 --> 02:52:22,439
in sandboxes but then at some point you
 

9677
02:52:22,439 --> 02:52:23,790
in sandboxes but then at some point you
know the language model pre-training is

9678
02:52:23,790 --> 02:52:23,800
know the language model pre-training is
 

9679
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:25,990
know the language model pre-training is
going to be dwarfed by what is this

9680
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:26,000
going to be dwarfed by what is this

9683
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:29,309
reinforcement learning you know you
you'll pre-train a multimodal model that

9684
02:52:29,309 --> 02:52:29,319
you'll pre-train a multimodal model that
 

9685
02:52:29,319 --> 02:52:31,309
you'll pre-train a multimodal model that
can see that can read that can write you

approach math with language models just
by increasing the number of samples so

by increasing the number of samples so
 

9775
02:54:04,880 --> 02:54:06,229
by increasing the number of samples so
you can just try again and again and

you can just try again and again and
 

9777
02:54:06,239 --> 02:54:08,870
you can just try again and again and
again and you look at the amount of

again and you look at the amount of
 

9779
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:10,229
again and you look at the amount of
times that the language models get it

times that the language models get it
 

9781
02:54:10,239 --> 02:54:13,750
times that the language models get it
right and what we see is that even very

02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:13,760
right and what we see is that even very
 

9783
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:15,950
right and what we see is that even very
bad models get it right sometimes and

this RL training for fine tuning we use

10042
02:58:53,590 --> 02:58:53,600
this RL training for fine tuning we use
 

10043
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:56,389
this RL training for fine tuning we use
this in our like Tulu series of models

10044
02:58:56,389 --> 02:58:56,399
this in our like Tulu series of models
 

10045
02:58:56,399 --> 02:58:58,670
this in our like Tulu series of models
and you can elicit the same behaviors

10046
02:58:58,670 --> 02:58:58,680
and you can elicit the same behaviors
 

10047
02:58:58,680 --> 02:59:01,469
and you can elicit the same behaviors
where you say like wait and so and so on

10048
02:59:01,469 --> 02:59:01,479
where you say like wait and so and so on
 

10049
02:59:01,479 --> 02:59:03,389
where you say like wait and so and so on
but it's so late in the training process

10050
02:59:03,389 --> 02:59:03,399
but it's so late in the training process
 

10051
02:59:03,399 --> 02:59:05,150
but it's so late in the training process
that this kind of reasoning expression

10052
02:59:05,150 --> 02:59:05,160
that this kind of reasoning expression
 

10053
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:07,269
that this kind of reasoning expression
is much lighter so you can there's

10054
02:59:07,269 --> 02:59:07,279
is much lighter so you can there's
 

10055

there's essentially a gradiation and

02:59:08,790 --> 02:59:08,800
there's essentially a gradiation and
 

10057
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:10,349
there's essentially a gradiation and
just how much of this RL training you

10058
02:59:10,349 --> 02:59:10,359
just how much of this RL training you
 

10059
02:59:10,359 --> 02:59:12,150
just how much of this RL training you
put into it determines how the output

10060
02:59:12,150 --> 02:59:12,160
put into it determines how the output
 

10061

with the new o03 Mini model now that I
got a chance to spend many hours with it

in different kinds of context and
 

10177
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:56,389
in different kinds of context and
applications so I would probably

10178
03:01:56,389 --> 03:01:56,399
applications so I would probably
 

10179
03:01:56,399 --> 03:01:59,670
applications so I would probably
categorize this question as uh let's say

10180
03:01:59,670 --> 03:01:59,680
categorize this question as uh let's say
 

10181
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:02,190
categorize this question as uh let's say
open-ended philosophical question and in

open-ended philosophical question and in
 

10183
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:04,670
open-ended philosophical question and in
particular the emphasis on novelty I

10184
03:02:04,670 --> 03:02:04,680
particular the emphasis on novelty I
 

10185
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:08,190
particular the emphasis on novelty I
think is a nice way to uh test one of

10186
03:02:08,190 --> 03:02:08,200
think is a nice way to uh test one of
 

10187
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:09,750
think is a nice way to uh test one of
the capabilities of the model which is

03:02:09,750 --> 03:02:09,760
the capabilities of the model which is

I can go through many of them but the

10346
03:05:37,469 --> 03:05:37,479
I can go through many of them but the
 

10347
03:05:37,479 --> 03:05:39,269
I can go through many of them but the
first one was uh humans are the only

first one was uh humans are the only

symbolic resources then uses those

10352
03:05:44,349 --> 03:05:44,359
symbolic resources then uses those
 

10353
03:05:44,359 --> 03:05:46,389
symbolic resources then uses those
symbols to reorganize the very materials

10354

10436
03:07:38,349 --> 03:07:38,359
episode I I think I think when you you
 

10437

know to Nathan's point when you look at
like the reasoning models um to me even

10440
03:07:44,150 --> 03:07:44,160
like the reasoning models um to me even
 

10441
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:47,830
like the reasoning models um to me even
when I used R1 versus o1 there was like

10442
03:07:47,830 --> 03:07:47,840
when I used R1 versus o1 there was like
 

10443
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:49,550
when I used R1 versus o1 there was like
that sort of rough edges around the

10444
03:07:49,550 --> 03:07:49,560
that sort of rough edges around the
 

10445
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:51,990
that sort of rough edges around the

this version but the one from December

10450
03:07:55,590 --> 03:07:55,600
this version but the one from December
 

10451
03:07:55,600 --> 03:07:57,110
this version but the one from December
and it definitely had that rough edges

10452
03:07:57,110 --> 03:07:57,120
and it definitely had that rough edges
 

10453
03:07:57,120 --> 03:07:58,950
and it definitely had that rough edges
around the corner feeling right where

it's just not fleshed out in any as many

it's just not fleshed out in any as many
 

10457
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:03,790
it's just not fleshed out in any as many
ways right um sure they added math and

10458
03:08:03,790 --> 03:08:03,800
ways right um sure they added math and
 

10459
03:08:03,800 --> 03:08:05,670
ways right um sure they added math and
coding capabilities via these verifiers

in RL but you know they M it feels like

10462
03:08:08,630 --> 03:08:08,640
in RL but you know they M it feels like
 

10463
03:08:08,640 --> 03:08:10,229
in RL but you know they M it feels like
they lost something in certain areas and

10464
03:08:10,229 --> 03:08:10,239
they lost something in certain areas and
 

10465
03:08:10,239 --> 03:08:12,910
they lost something in certain areas and
01 is worse performing than chat in many

10466
03:08:12,910 --> 03:08:12,920
01 is worse performing than chat in many
 

10467
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:15,550
01 is worse performing than chat in many
areas as well to be clear um not by a

10468
03:08:15,550 --> 03:08:15,560
areas as well to be clear um not by a
 

10469
03:08:15,560 --> 03:08:17,110
areas as well to be clear um not by a
lot not by a lot though right and it's

10470
03:08:17,110 --> 03:08:17,120
lot not by a lot though right and it's
 

10471
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:19,630
lot not by a lot though right and it's
like some of like R1 definitely felt to

10472
03:08:19,630 --> 03:08:19,640
like some of like R1 definitely felt to
 

10473
03:08:19,640 --> 03:08:21,590
like some of like R1 definitely felt to
me like it was worse than V3 in certain

10474
03:08:21,590 --> 03:08:21,600
me like it was worse than V3 in certain
 

10475
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:24,389
me like it was worse than V3 in certain
areas like doing this RL expressed and

10476
03:08:24,389 --> 03:08:24,399
areas like doing this RL expressed and
 

10477
03:08:24,399 --> 03:08:26,269
areas like doing this RL expressed and
learned a lot but then it weakened in

10478
03:08:26,269 --> 03:08:26,279
learned a lot but then it weakened in
 

10479
03:08:26,279 --> 03:08:28,670
learned a lot but then it weakened in
other areas and so I think that's one of

10480
03:08:28,670 --> 03:08:28,680
other areas and so I think that's one of
 

10481
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:31,510
other areas and so I think that's one of
the big differences between these models

10482
03:08:31,510 --> 03:08:31,520
the big differences between these models
 

10483
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:33,910
the big differences between these models
and then and and and what o1 offers and

10484
03:08:33,910 --> 03:08:33,920
and then and and and what o1 offers and
 

10485
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:36,469
and then and and and what o1 offers and
then open AI has 01 Pro and what they

10486
03:08:36,469 --> 03:08:36,479
then open AI has 01 Pro and what they
 

10487
03:08:36,479 --> 03:08:38,590
then open AI has 01 Pro and what they
did with 03 which is like also very

10488
03:08:38,590 --> 03:08:38,600
did with 03 which is like also very
 

10489
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:41,190
did with 03 which is like also very
unique is that they stacked search on

10490
03:08:41,190 --> 03:08:41,200
unique is that they stacked search on
 

10491
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:43,710
unique is that they stacked search on
top of Chain of Thought right um and so

10492
03:08:43,710 --> 03:08:43,720
top of Chain of Thought right um and so
 

10493
03:08:43,720 --> 03:08:45,030
top of Chain of Thought right um and so
Chain of Thought is one thing where it's

10494
03:08:45,030 --> 03:08:45,040
Chain of Thought is one thing where it's
 

10495
03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:47,229
Chain of Thought is one thing where it's
able it's one chain it backtracks goes

10496

03:11:33,790 --> 03:11:33,800
uh thing that I pulled up earlier but uh
 

10659
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:37,710

the cost for uh gpt3 has plummeted if

10660
03:11:37,710 --> 03:11:37,720
the cost for uh gpt3 has plummeted if
 

10661
03:11:37,720 --> 03:11:39,830
the cost for uh gpt3 has plummeted if
you scroll up uh just a few images I

10662
03:11:39,830 --> 03:11:39,840
you scroll up uh just a few images I
 

10663
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:41,710
you scroll up uh just a few images I
think the important thing about like hey

10664
03:11:41,710 --> 03:11:41,720
think the important thing about like hey
 

10665
03:11:41,720 --> 03:11:44,309
think the important thing about like hey
is cost a limiting factor here right

10666
03:11:44,309 --> 03:11:44,319
is cost a limiting factor here right
 

10667
03:11:44,319 --> 03:11:46,110
is cost a limiting factor here right
like my my my view is that like we'll

10668
03:11:46,110 --> 03:11:46,120
like my my my view is that like we'll
 

10669
03:11:46,120 --> 03:11:48,349
like my my my view is that like we'll
have like really awesome intelligence

10670
03:11:48,349 --> 03:11:48,359
have like really awesome intelligence
 

10671
03:11:48,359 --> 03:11:50,389
have like really awesome intelligence
before we have like AGI before we have

10672
03:11:50,389 --> 03:11:50,399
before we have like AGI before we have
 

10673
03:11:50,399 --> 03:11:52,510
before we have like AGI before we have
it permeate throughout the economy um

10674
03:11:52,510 --> 03:11:52,520
it permeate throughout the economy um
 

10675
03:11:52,520 --> 03:11:54,190
it permeate throughout the economy um
and this is sort of why that reason is

10676
03:11:54,190 --> 03:11:54,200
and this is sort of why that reason is
 

10677
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:57,389
and this is sort of why that reason is
right gpt3 was trained in what 2020 2021

10678
03:11:57,389 --> 03:11:57,399
right gpt3 was trained in what 2020 2021
 

10679
03:11:57,399 --> 03:12:00,030
right gpt3 was trained in what 2020 2021
um and the cost for running inference on

10680
03:12:00,030 --> 03:12:00,040
um and the cost for running inference on
 

10681
03:12:00,040 --> 03:12:04,190
um and the cost for running inference on
it was $60 $70 per million tokens right

10682
03:12:04,190 --> 03:12:04,200
it was $60 $70 per million tokens right
 

10683
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:05,750
it was $60 $70 per million tokens right
um which was the cost per intelligence

10684
03:12:05,750 --> 03:12:05,760
um which was the cost per intelligence
 

10685
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:08,110
um which was the cost per intelligence
was ridiculous um now as we scaled

10686
03:12:08,110 --> 03:12:08,120
was ridiculous um now as we scaled
 

10687
03:12:08,120 --> 03:12:10,309
was ridiculous um now as we scaled

my God they made it so cheap it's like
actually if you look at this trend line

10724
03:12:55,830 --> 03:12:55,840
actually if you look at this trend line
 

10725
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:57,389
actually if you look at this trend line
they're not below the trend line first

10726
03:12:57,389 --> 03:12:57,399
they're not below the trend line first
 

10727
03:12:57,399 --> 03:12:59,790
they're not below the trend line first
of all and at least for gpt3 right uh

10728
03:12:59,790 --> 03:12:59,800
of all and at least for gpt3 right uh
 

10729
03:12:59,800 --> 03:13:01,070
of all and at least for gpt3 right uh
they are the first to hit it right which

03:13:01,070 --> 03:13:01,080
they are the first to hit it right which
 

10731
03:13:01,080 --> 03:13:02,710
they are the first to hit it right which
is which is a big deal um but they're

10732
03:13:02,710 --> 03:13:02,720
is which is a big deal um but they're
 

10733
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:04,950
is which is a big deal um but they're
not below the trend line as far as gpt3

10734
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:04,960
not below the trend line as far as gpt3
 

10735
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:06,590

now we have GPD 4 what's going to happen

10736
03:13:06,590 --> 03:13:06,600
now we have GPD 4 what's going to happen
 

10737

is going to take this cost curve down
 

10755
03:13:24,880 --> 03:13:27,190
is going to take this cost curve down
and down and down and down and then can

10756
03:13:27,190 --> 03:13:27,200
and down and down and down and then can
 

10757
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:29,710
and down and down and down and then can
I go in can I just spawn a thousand

03:13:29,710 --> 03:13:29,720
I go in can I just spawn a thousand
 

10759
03:13:29,720 --> 03:13:32,349
I go in can I just spawn a thousand
different llms to create a task and then

different llms to create a task and then
 

10761
03:13:32,359 --> 03:13:33,469
different llms to create a task and then
pick from one of them or you know

10762
03:13:33,469 --> 03:13:33,479
pick from one of them or you know
 

10763

03:13:35,190 --> 03:13:35,200
whatever search search technique I want
 

10765
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:37,309
whatever search search technique I want
a tree Monte Carlo tree search maybe it

10766
03:13:37,309 --> 03:13:37,319
a tree Monte Carlo tree search maybe it
 

10767
03:13:37,319 --> 03:13:39,309
a tree Monte Carlo tree search maybe it
gets that complicated um maybe it

10768
03:13:39,309 --> 03:13:39,319
gets that complicated um maybe it
 

10769
03:13:39,319 --> 03:13:40,550
gets that complicated um maybe it
doesn't because it's too complicated to

10770
03:13:40,550 --> 03:13:40,560
doesn't because it's too complicated to
 

10771
03:13:40,560 --> 03:13:42,429
doesn't because it's too complicated to
actually scale like who knows uh bitter

10772
03:13:42,429 --> 03:13:42,439
actually scale like who knows uh bitter
 

10773
03:13:42,439 --> 03:13:46,710
actually scale like who knows uh bitter
lesson right uh the the question is is I

10774
03:13:46,710 --> 03:13:46,720
lesson right uh the the question is is I
 

10775
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:48,790
lesson right uh the the question is is I
think when not if because the rate of

10776
03:13:48,790 --> 03:13:48,800
think when not if because the rate of
 

10777
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:52,190
think when not if because the rate of
progress is so fast right um 9 months

10778
03:13:52,190 --> 03:13:52,200
progress is so fast right um 9 months
 

10779
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:54,110
progress is so fast right um 9 months
ago Dario was saying Hey or you know

10780
03:13:54,110 --> 03:13:54,120
ago Dario was saying Hey or you know
 

10781
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:55,590
ago Dario was saying Hey or you know
Dario said 9 months ago the cost to

10782
03:13:55,590 --> 03:13:55,600
Dario said 9 months ago the cost to
 

10783
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:58,070
Dario said 9 months ago the cost to
train and inference was this right um

10784
03:13:58,070 --> 03:13:58,080
train and inference was this right um
 

10785
03:13:58,080 --> 03:13:59,429
train and inference was this right um
and now we're much better than this

10786
03:13:59,429 --> 03:13:59,439
and now we're much better than this
 

10787
03:13:59,439 --> 03:14:01,190
and now we're much better than this
right um and deep seek is much better

10788
03:14:01,190 --> 03:14:01,200
right um and deep seek is much better
 

10789
03:14:01,200 --> 03:14:02,830
right um and deep seek is much better
than this and and that cost curve for

10790
03:14:02,830 --> 03:14:02,840
than this and and that cost curve for
 

10791
03:14:02,840 --> 03:14:05,670
than this and and that cost curve for
gp4 which was also roughly $60 per

10792
03:14:05,670 --> 03:14:05,680
gp4 which was also roughly $60 per
 

10793
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:08,110
gp4 which was also roughly $60 per
million tokens when it launched has

10794
03:14:08,110 --> 03:14:08,120
million tokens when it launched has
 

10795
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:10,870
million tokens when it launched has
already fallen to you know $2 or so

10796
03:14:10,870 --> 03:14:10,880
already fallen to you know $2 or so
 

10797
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:12,229
already fallen to you know $2 or so
right and we're going to get it down to

10798
03:14:12,229 --> 03:14:12,239
right and we're going to get it down to
 

10799
03:14:12,239 --> 03:14:15,349
right and we're going to get it down to
cents probably for gp4 quality and the

10800
03:14:15,349 --> 03:14:15,359
cents probably for gp4 quality and the
 

10801
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:16,710
cents probably for gp4 quality and the
same and then G that's that that's the

10802
03:14:16,710 --> 03:14:16,720
same and then G that's that that's the
 

10803
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:19,510
same and then G that's that that's the
base for uh the reasoning models like 01

10804
03:14:19,510 --> 03:14:19,520
base for uh the reasoning models like 01
 

10805
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:21,309
base for uh the reasoning models like 01
that we have today and 01 Pro is

10806
03:14:21,309 --> 03:14:21,319
that we have today and 01 Pro is
 

10807
03:14:21,319 --> 03:14:23,750
that we have today and 01 Pro is
spawning more multiple right and 03 and

10808
03:14:23,750 --> 03:14:23,760
spawning more multiple right and 03 and
 

10809
03:14:23,760 --> 03:14:24,950
spawning more multiple right and 03 and
you know so on and so forth these search

10810
03:14:24,950 --> 03:14:24,960
you know so on and so forth these search
 

10811
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:26,910
you know so on and so forth these search
techniques too expensive today but they

10812
03:14:26,910 --> 03:14:26,920
techniques too expensive today but they
 

10813
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:28,710
techniques too expensive today but they
will get cheaper and that's that's

10814
03:14:28,710 --> 03:14:28,720
will get cheaper and that's that's
 

10815
03:14:28,720 --> 03:14:30,590
will get cheaper and that's that's
what's going to unlock the intelligence

10816
03:14:30,590 --> 03:14:30,600
what's going to unlock the intelligence
 

10817
03:14:30,600 --> 03:14:32,990
what's going to unlock the intelligence
right so it get cheaper and cheaper and

10818
03:14:32,990 --> 03:14:33,000
right so it get cheaper and cheaper and
 

10819
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:37,710
right so it get cheaper and cheaper and
cheaper the the big deep seek R1 release

10820
03:14:37,710 --> 03:14:37,720
cheaper the the big deep seek R1 release
 

10821
03:14:37,720 --> 03:14:39,110
cheaper the the big deep seek R1 release
freaked everybody out because of the

10822
03:14:39,110 --> 03:14:39,120
freaked everybody out because of the
 

10823
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:41,630
freaked everybody out because of the
cheaper one of the manifestations of

10824
03:14:41,630 --> 03:14:41,640
cheaper one of the manifestations of
 

10825
03:14:41,640 --> 03:14:44,190
cheaper one of the manifestations of
that is Nvidia stock plummeted uh can

10826
03:14:44,190 --> 03:14:44,200
that is Nvidia stock plummeted uh can
 

10827
03:14:44,200 --> 03:14:46,630
that is Nvidia stock plummeted uh can
you explain what happened I mean and

10828
03:14:46,630 --> 03:14:46,640
you explain what happened I mean and
 

10829
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:49,150
you explain what happened I mean and
also just explain this moment and

10830
03:14:49,150 --> 03:14:49,160
also just explain this moment and
 

10831
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:51,469
also just explain this moment and
whether you know if Nvidia is going to

10832
03:14:51,469 --> 03:14:51,479
whether you know if Nvidia is going to
 

10833
03:14:51,479 --> 03:14:54,190
whether you know if Nvidia is going to
keep winning we're both Nvidia Bulls

10834
03:14:54,190 --> 03:14:54,200
keep winning we're both Nvidia Bulls
 

10835
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:57,590
keep winning we're both Nvidia Bulls
here I would say and in some ways the

10836
03:14:57,590 --> 03:14:57,600
here I would say and in some ways the
 

10837
03:14:57,600 --> 03:14:59,750
here I would say and in some ways the
market response is reasonable most of

10838
03:14:59,750 --> 03:14:59,760
market response is reasonable most of
 

10839
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:02,630
market response is reasonable most of
the market like nvidia's biggest

10840
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:02,640
the market like nvidia's biggest
 

10841
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,309
the market like nvidia's biggest
customers in the US are major tech

10842
03:15:04,309 --> 03:15:04,319
customers in the US are major tech
 

10843
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:06,030
customers in the US are major tech
companies and they're spending a ton on

10844
03:15:06,030 --> 03:15:06,040
companies and they're spending a ton on
 

10845
03:15:06,040 --> 03:15:09,190
companies and they're spending a ton on
AI and if a simple interpretation of

10846
03:15:09,190 --> 03:15:09,200
AI and if a simple interpretation of
 

10847
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:10,750
AI and if a simple interpretation of
deep seek is you can get really good

10848
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:10,760
deep seek is you can get really good
 

10849
03:15:10,760 --> 03:15:13,710
deep seek is you can get really good
models without spending as much on AI so

10850
03:15:13,710 --> 03:15:13,720
models without spending as much on AI so
 

10851
03:15:13,720 --> 03:15:15,389
models without spending as much on AI so
in that capacity it's like oh maybe

10852
03:15:15,389 --> 03:15:15,399
in that capacity it's like oh maybe
 

10853
03:15:15,399 --> 03:15:16,630
in that capacity it's like oh maybe
these big tech companies won't need to

10854
03:15:16,630 --> 03:15:16,640
these big tech companies won't need to
 

10855
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:19,030
these big tech companies won't need to
spend much in Ai and go down the actual

10856
03:15:19,030 --> 03:15:19,040
spend much in Ai and go down the actual
 

10857
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:20,510
spend much in Ai and go down the actual
thing that happened is much more complex

10858
03:15:20,510 --> 03:15:20,520
thing that happened is much more complex
 

10859
03:15:20,520 --> 03:15:21,950
thing that happened is much more complex
where there's social factors where

10860
03:15:21,950 --> 03:15:21,960
where there's social factors where
 

10861
03:15:21,960 --> 03:15:24,469
where there's social factors where
there's the rising in the App Store the

10862
03:15:24,469 --> 03:15:24,479
there's the rising in the App Store the
 

10863
03:15:24,479 --> 03:15:26,269
there's the rising in the App Store the
social contagion that is happening and

10864
03:15:26,269 --> 03:15:26,279
social contagion that is happening and
 

10865
03:15:26,279 --> 03:15:27,990
social contagion that is happening and
then I think a lot some of it is just

10866
03:15:27,990 --> 03:15:28,000
then I think a lot some of it is just
 

10867
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:29,790
then I think a lot some of it is just
like I'm not I don't trade I don't know

10868
03:15:29,790 --> 03:15:29,800
like I'm not I don't trade I don't know
 

10869
03:15:29,800 --> 03:15:31,030
like I'm not I don't trade I don't know
anything about financial markets but it

10870
03:15:31,030 --> 03:15:31,040
anything about financial markets but it
 

10871
03:15:31,040 --> 03:15:32,670
anything about financial markets but it
builds up over the weekend or the social

10872
03:15:32,670 --> 03:15:32,680
builds up over the weekend or the social
 

10873
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:34,269
builds up over the weekend or the social
pressure where it's like if it was

10874
03:15:34,269 --> 03:15:34,279
pressure where it's like if it was
 

10875
03:15:34,279 --> 03:15:35,750
pressure where it's like if it was
during the week and there was multiple

10876
03:15:35,750 --> 03:15:35,760
during the week and there was multiple
 

10877
03:15:35,760 --> 03:15:37,349
during the week and there was multiple
days of trading when this was really

10878
03:15:37,349 --> 03:15:37,359
days of trading when this was really
 

10879
03:15:37,359 --> 03:15:38,990
days of trading when this was really
becoming but it comes on the weekend and

10880
03:15:38,990 --> 03:15:39,000
becoming but it comes on the weekend and
 

10881
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,910
becoming but it comes on the weekend and
then everybody wants to sell and that is

10882
03:15:41,910 --> 03:15:41,920
then everybody wants to sell and that is
 

10883
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:44,110
then everybody wants to sell and that is
a social contagion I think I think and

10884
03:15:44,110 --> 03:15:44,120
a social contagion I think I think and
 

10885
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:45,389
a social contagion I think I think and
like there were a lot of false

10886
03:15:45,389 --> 03:15:45,399
like there were a lot of false
 

10887
03:15:45,399 --> 03:15:47,349
like there were a lot of false
narratives which is like hey guys are

10888
03:15:47,349 --> 03:15:47,359
narratives which is like hey guys are
 

10889
03:15:47,359 --> 03:15:49,070
narratives which is like hey guys are
spending billions on models right and

10890
03:15:49,070 --> 03:15:49,080
spending billions on models right and
 

10891
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:50,469
spending billions on models right and
they're not spending billions on models

10892
03:15:50,469 --> 03:15:50,479
they're not spending billions on models
 

10893
03:15:50,479 --> 03:15:52,830
they're not spending billions on models
no one spent more than a billion dollars

10894
03:15:52,830 --> 03:15:52,840
no one spent more than a billion dollars
 

10895
03:15:52,840 --> 03:15:54,510
no one spent more than a billion dollars
on a Model that's released publicly

10896
03:15:54,510 --> 03:15:54,520
on a Model that's released publicly
 

10897
03:15:54,520 --> 03:15:57,590
on a Model that's released publicly
right gp4 was a couple hundred million

10898
03:15:57,590 --> 03:15:57,600
right gp4 was a couple hundred million
 

10899
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:59,189
right gp4 was a couple hundred million
and then you know they've reduced the

10900
03:15:59,189 --> 03:15:59,199
and then you know they've reduced the
 

10901
03:15:59,199 --> 03:16:02,389
and then you know they've reduced the
cost with 40 all four turbo 40 right um

10902
03:16:02,389 --> 03:16:02,399
cost with 40 all four turbo 40 right um
 

10903
03:16:02,399 --> 03:16:04,229
cost with 40 all four turbo 40 right um
but billion dollar model runs are coming

10904
03:16:04,229 --> 03:16:04,239
but billion dollar model runs are coming
 

10905
03:16:04,239 --> 03:16:06,309
but billion dollar model runs are coming
right um this concludes pre-training and

10906
03:16:06,309 --> 03:16:06,319
right um this concludes pre-training and
 

10907
03:16:06,319 --> 03:16:07,189
right um this concludes pre-training and
post-training right and then the other

10908
03:16:07,189 --> 03:16:07,199
post-training right and then the other
 

10909
03:16:07,199 --> 03:16:08,750
post-training right and then the other
number is like hey deep seek didn't

10910
03:16:08,750 --> 03:16:08,760
number is like hey deep seek didn't
 

10911
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:09,830
number is like hey deep seek didn't
include everything right they didn't

10912
03:16:09,830 --> 03:16:09,840
include everything right they didn't
 

10913
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:11,189
include everything right they didn't
include you know a lot of the cost goes

10914
03:16:11,189 --> 03:16:11,199
include you know a lot of the cost goes
 

10915
03:16:11,199 --> 03:16:12,790
include you know a lot of the cost goes
to research and all this sort of stuff a

10916
03:16:12,790 --> 03:16:12,800
to research and all this sort of stuff a
 

10917
03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:14,389
to research and all this sort of stuff a
lot of the cost goes to inference a lot

10918
03:16:14,389 --> 03:16:14,399
lot of the cost goes to inference a lot
 

10919
03:16:14,399 --> 03:16:15,670
lot of the cost goes to inference a lot
of the cost goes to post training none

10920
03:16:15,670 --> 03:16:15,680
of the cost goes to post training none
 

10921
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:17,189
of the cost goes to post training none
of these things were factored research

10922
03:16:17,189 --> 03:16:17,199
of these things were factored research
 

10923
03:16:17,199 --> 03:16:19,110
of these things were factored research
salaries right like all these things are

10924
03:16:19,110 --> 03:16:19,120
salaries right like all these things are
 

10925
03:16:19,120 --> 03:16:20,790
salaries right like all these things are
like counted in the billions of dollars

10926
03:16:20,790 --> 03:16:20,800
like counted in the billions of dollars
 

10927
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:22,429
like counted in the billions of dollars
that open is spending but they weren't

10928
03:16:22,429 --> 03:16:22,439
that open is spending but they weren't
 

10929
03:16:22,439 --> 03:16:24,710
that open is spending but they weren't
counted in the you know hey 6 million 5

10930
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:24,720
counted in the you know hey 6 million 5
 

10931
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:26,590
counted in the you know hey 6 million 5
million that deep seek spent right so

10932
03:16:26,590 --> 03:16:26,600
million that deep seek spent right so
 

10933
03:16:26,600 --> 03:16:28,229
million that deep seek spent right so
but so there's a bit of misunderstanding

10934
03:16:28,229 --> 03:16:28,239
but so there's a bit of misunderstanding
 

10935
03:16:28,239 --> 03:16:30,150
but so there's a bit of misunderstanding
of what these numbers are um and then

10936
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:30,160
of what these numbers are um and then
 

10937
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:31,870
of what these numbers are um and then
there's also an element

10938
03:16:31,870 --> 03:16:31,880
there's also an element
 

10939
03:16:31,880 --> 03:16:33,990
there's also an element
of Nvidia has just been a straight line

10940
03:16:33,990 --> 03:16:34,000
of Nvidia has just been a straight line
 

10941
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:36,670
of Nvidia has just been a straight line
up right and and there's been so many

10942
03:16:36,670 --> 03:16:36,680
up right and and there's been so many
 

10943
03:16:36,680 --> 03:16:37,990
up right and and there's been so many
different narratives that have been

10944
03:16:37,990 --> 03:16:38,000

03:18:10,790 --> 03:18:10,800
transistors just like clockwork and it's
 

11033
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:12,550
transistors just like clockwork and it's
slowed down obviously but like the

03:18:12,550 --> 03:18:12,560
slowed down obviously but like the
 

11035
03:18:12,560 --> 03:18:14,510
slowed down obviously but like the
semiconductor industry has gone up the

11036
03:18:14,510 --> 03:18:14,520
semiconductor industry has gone up the
 

11037
03:18:14,520 --> 03:18:15,990
semiconductor industry has gone up the
whole time right they it's been wavy

11038
03:18:15,990 --> 03:18:16,000
whole time right they it's been wavy
 

11039
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:17,830
whole time right they it's been wavy
right there's obviously and stuff and I

don't expect AI to be any different

11042
03:18:19,309 --> 03:18:19,319
don't expect AI to be any different
 

11043
03:18:19,319 --> 03:18:21,630
don't expect AI to be any different
right there's going to be and flows but

11044
03:18:21,630 --> 03:18:21,640
right there's going to be and flows but
 

11045
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:23,389
right there's going to be and flows but
this is in AI it's just playing out at

11046
03:18:23,389 --> 03:18:23,399
this is in AI it's just playing out at
 

11047
03:18:23,399 --> 03:18:25,830
this is in AI it's just playing out at
an insane time scale right it was 2x

11048
03:18:25,830 --> 03:18:25,840
an insane time scale right it was 2x
 

11049
03:18:25,840 --> 03:18:28,429
an insane time scale right it was 2x
every two years this is 1200X in like

11050
03:18:28,429 --> 03:18:28,439
every two years this is 1200X in like
 

11051
03:18:28,439 --> 03:18:31,110
every two years this is 1200X in like
three years right so it's like the the

11052
03:18:31,110 --> 03:18:31,120
three years right so it's like the the
 

11053
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:33,070
three years right so it's like the the
scale of improvement that is like hard

11054
03:18:33,070 --> 03:18:33,080
scale of improvement that is like hard
 

11055
03:18:33,080 --> 03:18:35,150
scale of improvement that is like hard
to get wrap your head around yeah I was

11056
03:18:35,150 --> 03:18:35,160
to get wrap your head around yeah I was
 

11057
03:18:35,160 --> 03:18:37,389
to get wrap your head around yeah I was
confused because I to me Nvidia thought

11058
03:18:37,389 --> 03:18:37,399
confused because I to me Nvidia thought
 

11059
03:18:37,399 --> 03:18:40,750
confused because I to me Nvidia thought
on that should have gone up but maybe

11060
03:18:40,750 --> 03:18:40,760
on that should have gone up but maybe
 

11061
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:42,630
on that should have gone up but maybe
went down because there's kind of

11062
03:18:42,630 --> 03:18:42,640
went down because there's kind of
 

11063
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:44,389
went down because there's kind of
Suspicion of fall play on the side of

11064
03:18:44,389 --> 03:18:44,399
Suspicion of fall play on the side of
 

11065
03:18:44,399 --> 03:18:46,150
Suspicion of fall play on the side of
China or something like this but if you

11066
03:18:46,150 --> 03:18:46,160
China or something like this but if you
 

11067
03:18:46,160 --> 03:18:48,229
China or something like this but if you
just look purely at the actual

11068
03:18:48,229 --> 03:18:48,239
just look purely at the actual
 

11069
03:18:48,239 --> 03:18:50,510
just look purely at the actual
principles that play here like it's

11070
03:18:50,510 --> 03:18:50,520
principles that play here like it's
 

11071
03:18:50,520 --> 03:18:52,910
principles that play here like it's
obvious yeah Javon par more progress

11072
03:18:52,910 --> 03:18:52,920
obvious yeah Javon par more progress
 

11073
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:55,910
obvious yeah Javon par more progress
that AI makes or the higher the

11074
03:18:55,910 --> 03:18:55,920
that AI makes or the higher the
 

11075
03:18:55,920 --> 03:18:58,110
that AI makes or the higher the
derivative of AI progress is especially

11076
03:18:58,110 --> 03:18:58,120
derivative of AI progress is especially
 

11077
03:18:58,120 --> 03:18:59,790
derivative of AI progress is especially
you should because Nvidia is in the best

11078
03:18:59,790 --> 03:18:59,800
you should because Nvidia is in the best
 

11079
03:18:59,800 --> 03:19:01,389
you should because Nvidia is in the best
place the higher the derivative is the

11080
03:19:01,389 --> 03:19:01,399
place the higher the derivative is the
 

11081
03:19:01,399 --> 03:19:02,990
place the higher the derivative is the
sooner the Market's going to be bigger

11082
03:19:02,990 --> 03:19:03,000
sooner the Market's going to be bigger
 

11083
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,030
sooner the Market's going to be bigger
and expanding and Nvidia is the only one

11084
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:05,040
and expanding and Nvidia is the only one
 

11085
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:07,510
and expanding and Nvidia is the only one
that does everything reliably right now

11086
03:19:07,510 --> 03:19:07,520
that does everything reliably right now
 

11087
03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:08,990
that does everything reliably right now
because it's not like an Nvidia

11088
03:19:08,990 --> 03:19:09,000
because it's not like an Nvidia
 

11089
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:12,309
because it's not like an Nvidia
competitor arose it's it's another

11090
03:19:12,309 --> 03:19:12,319
competitor arose it's it's another
 

11091
03:19:12,319 --> 03:19:14,790
competitor arose it's it's another
company that's using Nvidia who

11092
03:19:14,790 --> 03:19:14,800

you know and that's like small scale

11250
03:22:02,030 --> 03:22:02,040
you know and that's like small scale
 

11251
03:22:02,040 --> 03:22:03,309
you know and that's like small scale
smuggling most of the large scale

11252
03:22:03,309 --> 03:22:03,319
smuggling most of the large scale
 

11253
03:22:03,319 --> 03:22:05,870
smuggling most of the large scale
smuggling is like companies in Singapore

11254

smuggling is like companies in Singapore
 

11255
03:22:05,880 --> 03:22:07,870
smuggling is like companies in Singapore
and Malaysia like routing them around or

and Malaysia like routing them around or
 

11257
03:22:07,880 --> 03:22:10,189

renting gpus completely legally I want

11258
03:22:10,189 --> 03:22:10,199
renting gpus completely legally I want
 

11259
03:22:10,199 --> 03:22:11,670
renting gpus completely legally I want
to jump in how much do the scale I think

11260
03:22:11,670 --> 03:22:11,680
to jump in how much do the scale I think
 

11261
03:22:11,680 --> 03:22:12,870
to jump in how much do the scale I think
there's been some number like some

11262
03:22:12,870 --> 03:22:12,880
there's been some number like some
 

11263
03:22:12,880 --> 03:22:15,189
there's been some number like some
people that have higher level

11264
03:22:15,189 --> 03:22:15,199
people that have higher level
 

11265
03:22:15,199 --> 03:22:17,469
people that have higher level
economics understanding say that like as

11266
03:22:17,469 --> 03:22:17,479
economics understanding say that like as
 

11267
03:22:17,479 --> 03:22:19,429
economics understanding say that like as
you go from 1 billion of smuggling to 10

11268
03:22:19,429 --> 03:22:19,439
you go from 1 billion of smuggling to 10
 

11269
03:22:19,439 --> 03:22:21,150
you go from 1 billion of smuggling to 10
billion it's like you're hiding certain

11270
03:22:21,150 --> 03:22:21,160
billion it's like you're hiding certain
 

11271
03:22:21,160 --> 03:22:22,990
billion it's like you're hiding certain
levels of economic activity and that's

11272
03:22:22,990 --> 03:22:23,000
levels of economic activity and that's
 

11273
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:24,469
levels of economic activity and that's
the most reasonable thing to me is that

11274
03:22:24,469 --> 03:22:24,479
the most reasonable thing to me is that
 

11275
03:22:24,479 --> 03:22:25,630
the most reasonable thing to me is that
there's going to be some level where

11276
03:22:25,630 --> 03:22:25,640
there's going to be some level where
 

11277
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:28,150
there's going to be some level where
it's so obvious that it's easier to find

11278
03:22:28,150 --> 03:22:28,160
it's so obvious that it's easier to find
 

11279
03:22:28,160 --> 03:22:30,990
it's so obvious that it's easier to find
this economic activity and yeah so so so

11280
03:22:30,990 --> 03:22:31,000
this economic activity and yeah so so so
 

11281
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:34,150
this economic activity and yeah so so so
my my my belief is that last year

11282
03:22:34,150 --> 03:22:34,160
my my my belief is that last year
 

11283
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:36,429
my my my belief is that last year
roughly uh so so Nvidia made a million

11284
03:22:36,429 --> 03:22:36,439
roughly uh so so Nvidia made a million
 

11285
03:22:36,439 --> 03:22:38,269
roughly uh so so Nvidia made a million
h20s which are legally allowed to be

11286

you go down the list of clouds and

11338
03:23:31,750 --> 03:23:31,760
you go down the list of clouds and
 

11339
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:33,070
you go down the list of clouds and
especially these smaller Cloud companies

11340
03:23:33,070 --> 03:23:33,080
especially these smaller Cloud companies
 

11341
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:35,550
especially these smaller Cloud companies
that aren't like the hyperscalers right

11342
03:23:35,550 --> 03:23:35,560
that aren't like the hyperscalers right
 

11343
03:23:35,560 --> 03:23:38,189
that aren't like the hyperscalers right
um think Beyond cor Lambda even there's

11344
03:23:38,189 --> 03:23:38,199
um think Beyond cor Lambda even there's
 

11345
03:23:38,199 --> 03:23:40,189
um think Beyond cor Lambda even there's
a whole C there's 60 different new Cloud

11346
03:23:40,189 --> 03:23:40,199
a whole C there's 60 different new Cloud
 

11347

companies serving Nidia gpus I think B

11348
03:23:42,070 --> 03:23:42,080

dance is renting a lot of these right um

11350
03:23:44,030 --> 03:23:44,040
dance is renting a lot of these right um
 

11351
03:23:44,040 --> 03:23:46,870
dance is renting a lot of these right um
all over right and so these companies

11352
03:23:46,870 --> 03:23:46,880
all over right and so these companies
 

11353
03:23:46,880 --> 03:23:49,070
all over right and so these companies
are renting gpus to Chinese companies

11354
03:23:49,070 --> 03:23:49,080
are renting gpus to Chinese companies
 

11355
03:23:49,080 --> 03:23:50,189
are renting gpus to Chinese companies
and that's completely that was

11356
03:23:50,189 --> 03:23:50,199
and that's completely that was
 

11357
03:23:50,199 --> 03:23:52,710
and that's completely that was
completely legal up until the diffusion

11358
03:23:52,710 --> 03:23:52,720
completely legal up until the diffusion
 

11359
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:54,030
completely legal up until the diffusion
rules which happened just a few weeks

11360
03:23:54,030 --> 03:23:54,040
rules which happened just a few weeks
 

11361
03:23:54,040 --> 03:23:56,389
rules which happened just a few weeks
ago and even now you can rent GPU

11362
03:23:56,389 --> 03:23:56,399
ago and even now you can rent GPU
 

11363
03:23:56,399 --> 03:23:58,429
ago and even now you can rent GPU
clusters that are less than 2,000 gpus

11364
03:23:58,429 --> 03:23:58,439
clusters that are less than 2,000 gpus
 

11365
03:23:58,439 --> 03:24:00,510
clusters that are less than 2,000 gpus
or you can buy gpus and ship them

11366
03:24:00,510 --> 03:24:00,520
or you can buy gpus and ship them
 

11367
03:24:00,520 --> 03:24:01,950
or you can buy gpus and ship them
wherever you want if you're if they're

11368
03:24:01,950 --> 03:24:01,960
wherever you want if you're if they're
 

11369
03:24:01,960 --> 03:24:03,950
wherever you want if you're if they're
less than 1500 gpus right so it's like

11370
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:03,960
less than 1500 gpus right so it's like
 

11371
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:05,950
less than 1500 gpus right so it's like
there are still like some ways to

11372
03:24:05,950 --> 03:24:05,960
there are still like some ways to
 

11373
03:24:05,960 --> 03:24:07,870
there are still like some ways to
smuggle but yeah it's not you know as

11374
03:24:07,870 --> 03:24:07,880
smuggle but yeah it's not you know as
 

11375
03:24:07,880 --> 03:24:10,389
smuggle but yeah it's not you know as
the numbers grow right uh you know 100

11376
03:24:10,389 --> 03:24:10,399
the numbers grow right uh you know 100
 

11377
03:24:10,399 --> 03:24:11,590
the numbers grow right uh you know 100
something billion dollars of revenue for

11378
03:24:11,590 --> 03:24:11,600
something billion dollars of revenue for
 

11379
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:13,429
something billion dollars of revenue for
NVIDIA last year 200 something billion

11380
03:24:13,429 --> 03:24:13,439
NVIDIA last year 200 something billion
 

11381
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:15,590
NVIDIA last year 200 something billion
this year right and if next year or you

11382
03:24:15,590 --> 03:24:15,600
this year right and if next year or you
 

11383
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:18,070
this year right and if next year or you
know it could it could nearly double

11384
03:24:18,070 --> 03:24:18,080
know it could it could nearly double
 

11385
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:19,950
know it could it could nearly double
again or more than double right based on

11386
03:24:19,950 --> 03:24:19,960
again or more than double right based on
 

11387
03:24:19,960 --> 03:24:21,229
again or more than double right based on
like what we see with data center

11388
03:24:21,229 --> 03:24:21,239

this is very different than like a

03:27:54,269 --> 03:27:54,279
this is very different than like a
 

11595
03:27:54,279 --> 03:27:55,710
this is very different than like a

03:27:57,399 --> 03:27:59,269

11601
03:27:59,279 --> 03:28:00,710
hinges on a word that is very unclear in
the AI space which is what is a

11602
03:28:00,710 --> 03:28:00,720
the AI space which is what is a
 

11603
03:28:00,720 --> 03:28:03,150
the AI space which is what is a
competitor so and then the ethical

11604
03:28:03,150 --> 03:28:03,160
competitor so and then the ethical
 

11605
03:28:03,160 --> 03:28:05,750
competitor so and then the ethical
aspect of it is like why is it unethical

11606
03:28:05,750 --> 03:28:05,760
aspect of it is like why is it unethical
 

11607
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:07,469
aspect of it is like why is it unethical
for me to train on your model when you

11608
03:28:07,469 --> 03:28:07,479
for me to train on your model when you
 

11609
03:28:07,479 --> 03:28:09,630
for me to train on your model when you
can train on the internet's text yeah

11610
03:28:09,630 --> 03:28:09,640
can train on the internet's text yeah
 

11611
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:12,110
can train on the internet's text yeah
right so there's a bit of a hypocrisy

11612
03:28:12,110 --> 03:28:12,120
right so there's a bit of a hypocrisy
 

11613
03:28:12,120 --> 03:28:16,150
right so there's a bit of a hypocrisy
because sort of open Ai and potentially

11614
03:28:16,150 --> 03:28:16,160
because sort of open Ai and potentially
 

11615
03:28:16,160 --> 03:28:18,150
because sort of open Ai and potentially
most of the companies trained on the

11616
03:28:18,150 --> 03:28:18,160
most of the companies trained on the
 

11617
03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:20,189
most of the companies trained on the
internet's text without permission

11618
03:28:20,189 --> 03:28:20,199
internet's text without permission
 

11619
03:28:20,199 --> 03:28:22,030
internet's text without permission
there's also a clear loophole which is

11620
03:28:22,030 --> 03:28:22,040
there's also a clear loophole which is
 

11621
03:28:22,040 --> 03:28:25,469
there's also a clear loophole which is
that uh I generate data from open Ai and

11622
03:28:25,469 --> 03:28:25,479
that uh I generate data from open Ai and
 

11623
03:28:25,479 --> 03:28:27,189
that uh I generate data from open Ai and
then I upload it somewhere and then

11624
03:28:27,189 --> 03:28:27,199
then I upload it somewhere and then
 

11625
03:28:27,199 --> 03:28:29,030
then I upload it somewhere and then
somebody else trains on it and the link

11626
03:28:29,030 --> 03:28:29,040
somebody else trains on it and the link
 

11627
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:30,910
somebody else trains on it and the link
has been broken like they're they're not

11628
03:28:30,910 --> 03:28:30,920
has been broken like they're they're not
 

11629
03:28:30,920 --> 03:28:32,990
has been broken like they're they're not
under the same terms of service contract

11630
03:28:32,990 --> 03:28:33,000
under the same terms of service contract
 

11631
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:34,429
under the same terms of service contract
this is this is why there's a lot of

11632
03:28:34,429 --> 03:28:34,439
this is this is why there's a lot of
 

11633
03:28:34,439 --> 03:28:36,429
this is this is why there's a lot of
hipop there's a lot of like to be

11634
03:28:36,429 --> 03:28:36,439
hipop there's a lot of like to be
 

11635
03:28:36,439 --> 03:28:38,070
hipop there's a lot of like to be
discovered details that don't make a lot

11636
03:28:38,070 --> 03:28:38,080
discovered details that don't make a lot
 

11637
03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:39,750
discovered details that don't make a lot
of sense this is why a lot of models

11638
03:28:39,750 --> 03:28:39,760
of sense this is why a lot of models
 

11639
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:42,349
of sense this is why a lot of models
today even if they train on zero open AI

11640
03:28:42,349 --> 03:28:42,359
today even if they train on zero open AI

11643
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:46,790

it'll say I was I'm Chad P trained by

it'll say I was I'm Chad P trained by

it'll say I was I'm Chad P trained by

03:30:32,439 --> 03:30:34,750
ship the narrative like they're trying

training on outputs there's other AI

11758
03:30:40,550 --> 03:30:40,560
training on outputs there's other AI
 

11759
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:42,710
training on outputs there's other AI
startups that most people if you're in

11760
03:30:42,710 --> 03:30:42,720

the like AI culture were like they just

11762
03:30:45,150 --> 03:30:45,160
the like AI culture were like they just
 

11763
03:30:45,160 --> 03:30:46,670
the like AI culture were like they just
told us they trained on opening eye

11764
03:30:46,670 --> 03:30:46,680
told us they trained on opening eye
 

11765
03:30:46,680 --> 03:30:48,590
told us they trained on opening eye
outputs and they never got banned like

11766
03:30:48,590 --> 03:30:48,600
outputs and they never got banned like
 

11767
03:30:48,600 --> 03:30:50,510
outputs and they never got banned like
that's how they bootstrapped their early

11768
03:30:50,510 --> 03:30:50,520
that's how they bootstrapped their early
 

11769
03:30:50,520 --> 03:30:52,309
that's how they bootstrapped their early
models so it's much easier to get off

11770
03:30:52,309 --> 03:30:52,319
models so it's much easier to get off
 

11771
03:30:52,319 --> 03:30:53,950
models so it's much easier to get off
the ground using this than to set up

03:30:53,960 --> 03:30:56,429
the ground using this than to set up
human pipelines and build a strong model

human pipelines and build a strong model
 

11775
03:30:56,439 --> 03:30:58,429
human pipelines and build a strong model
so there long history here and a lot of

03:30:58,429 --> 03:30:58,439
so there long history here and a lot of
 

11777

the communications are seem like
narrative control actually like the over

11780
03:31:01,710 --> 03:31:01,720

11781
03:31:01,720 --> 03:31:03,469

the last couple days we've seen a lot of

11782
03:31:03,469 --> 03:31:03,479
the last couple days we've seen a lot of
 

11783
03:31:03,479 --> 03:31:05,630
the last couple days we've seen a lot of
people distill deep seeks model into

11784
03:31:05,630 --> 03:31:05,640
people distill deep seeks model into
 

11785
03:31:05,640 --> 03:31:07,510
people distill deep seeks model into
llama models because because the Deep

11786
03:31:07,510 --> 03:31:07,520
llama models because because the Deep
 

11787
03:31:07,520 --> 03:31:08,830
llama models because because the Deep
seek models are kind of complicated to

11788
03:31:08,830 --> 03:31:08,840
seek models are kind of complicated to
 

11789
03:31:08,840 --> 03:31:10,670
seek models are kind of complicated to
run inference on because their mixture

11790
03:31:10,670 --> 03:31:10,680
run inference on because their mixture
 

11791
03:31:10,680 --> 03:31:12,950
run inference on because their mixture
of experts and their you know 600 plus

11792
03:31:12,950 --> 03:31:12,960
of experts and their you know 600 plus
 

11793
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:14,429
of experts and their you know 600 plus
billion parameters and all this and

11794
03:31:14,429 --> 03:31:14,439
billion parameters and all this and
 

11795
03:31:14,439 --> 03:31:15,910
billion parameters and all this and
people distilled them into the llama

11796
03:31:15,910 --> 03:31:15,920
people distilled them into the llama
 

11797
03:31:15,920 --> 03:31:17,469
people distilled them into the llama
model and then because the Llama models

11798
03:31:17,469 --> 03:31:17,479
model and then because the Llama models
 

11799
03:31:17,479 --> 03:31:18,910
model and then because the Llama models
are so easy to serve and everyone's

11800
03:31:18,910 --> 03:31:18,920
are so easy to serve and everyone's
 

11801
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:20,349
are so easy to serve and everyone's
built the pipelines and tooling for

11802
03:31:20,349 --> 03:31:20,359
built the pipelines and tooling for
 

11803
03:31:20,359 --> 03:31:22,110
built the pipelines and tooling for
inference with the Llama models right

11804
03:31:22,110 --> 03:31:22,120
inference with the Llama models right
 

11805
03:31:22,120 --> 03:31:24,429
inference with the Llama models right
because it's the open standard so you

11806
03:31:24,429 --> 03:31:24,439
because it's the open standard so you
 

11807
03:31:24,439 --> 03:31:25,750
because it's the open standard so you
know we've seen it we've seen a sort of

11808
03:31:25,750 --> 03:31:25,760
know we've seen it we've seen a sort of
 

11809
03:31:25,760 --> 03:31:27,790
know we've seen it we've seen a sort of
roundabout right like is it is it bad is

11810
03:31:27,790 --> 03:31:27,800
roundabout right like is it is it bad is
 

11811
03:31:27,800 --> 03:31:29,590
roundabout right like is it is it bad is
it illegal maybe it's illegal whatever I

11812
03:31:29,590 --> 03:31:29,600
it illegal maybe it's illegal whatever I
 

11813
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:31,110
it illegal maybe it's illegal whatever I
don't know about that but like it could

11814
03:31:31,110 --> 03:31:31,120
don't know about that but like it could
 

11815
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:32,349
don't know about that but like it could
break contracts I don't think it's

11816
03:31:32,349 --> 03:31:32,359
break contracts I don't think it's
 

11817
03:31:32,359 --> 03:31:34,429
break contracts I don't think it's
illegal like in any legal like no one's

11818
03:31:34,429 --> 03:31:34,439
illegal like in any legal like no one's
 

11819
03:31:34,439 --> 03:31:36,229
illegal like in any legal like no one's
going to jail for this ever I I think

11820
03:31:36,229 --> 03:31:36,239
going to jail for this ever I I think
 

11821
03:31:36,239 --> 03:31:38,469
going to jail for this ever I I think
like fundamentally I think it's ethical

11822
03:31:38,469 --> 03:31:38,479
like fundamentally I think it's ethical
 

11823
03:31:38,479 --> 03:31:40,990
like fundamentally I think it's ethical
or I hope it's ethical because like the

11824
03:31:40,990 --> 03:31:41,000
or I hope it's ethical because like the
 

11825
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:44,790
or I hope it's ethical because like the
moment becomes we ban that kind of thing

11826
03:31:44,790 --> 03:31:44,800
moment becomes we ban that kind of thing
 

11827
03:31:44,800 --> 03:31:46,670
moment becomes we ban that kind of thing
it's going to make everybody much worse

11828
03:31:46,670 --> 03:31:46,680
it's going to make everybody much worse
 

11829
03:31:46,680 --> 03:31:50,910
it's going to make everybody much worse
off and I also actually it's this is

11830
03:31:50,910 --> 03:31:50,920
off and I also actually it's this is
 

11831
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:53,150
off and I also actually it's this is
difficult but I think you should be

11832
03:31:53,150 --> 03:31:53,160
difficult but I think you should be
 

11833
03:31:53,160 --> 03:31:55,309
difficult but I think you should be
allowed to train on the internet I know

11834
03:31:55,309 --> 03:31:55,319
allowed to train on the internet I know
 

11835
03:31:55,319 --> 03:31:56,910
allowed to train on the internet I know
a lot of authors and creators are very

11836
03:31:56,910 --> 03:31:56,920
a lot of authors and creators are very
 

11837
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:58,630
a lot of authors and creators are very
sensitive about it that's that's a

unlikely you can make it difficult but
 

11997
03:34:54,960 --> 03:34:56,429
unlikely you can make it difficult but
even then like there's all these stories

their 20s and 30s not everyone but like

12028
03:35:27,710 --> 03:35:27,720
their 20s and 30s not everyone but like

we are very easily corrupted right like
 

12047
03:35:48,319 --> 03:35:50,710
we are very easily corrupted right like
you know like not not not corrupted

03:36:06,670 --> 03:36:06,680
vulnerabilities so you uh Dylan collect
 

12063
03:36:06,680 --> 03:36:09,750

a lot of information about each of the
 

12065
03:36:09,760 --> 03:36:11,790
a lot of information about each of the
the mega clusters for each of the major

AI companies can can you uh talk about

12068
03:36:15,070 --> 03:36:15,080
AI companies can can you uh talk about
 

12069
03:36:15,080 --> 03:36:16,309
AI companies can can you uh talk about
the buildout

12070
03:36:16,309 --> 03:36:16,319
the buildout
 

12071
03:36:16,319 --> 03:36:18,910
the buildout
for each one that stand out yeah so I

12072
03:36:18,910 --> 03:36:18,920
for each one that stand out yeah so I
 

12073
03:36:18,920 --> 03:36:20,349
for each one that stand out yeah so I
think the thing that's like really

12074
03:36:20,349 --> 03:36:20,359
think the thing that's like really
 

12075
03:36:20,359 --> 03:36:22,189
think the thing that's like really
important about these Mega cluster build

12076
03:36:22,189 --> 03:36:22,199
important about these Mega cluster build
 

12077
03:36:22,199 --> 03:36:24,309
important about these Mega cluster build
outs is they're completely unprecedented

12078
03:36:24,309 --> 03:36:24,319
outs is they're completely unprecedented
 

12079
03:36:24,319 --> 03:36:27,910
outs is they're completely unprecedented
in scale right um us you know sort of

12080
03:36:27,910 --> 03:36:27,920
in scale right um us you know sort of
 

12081
03:36:27,920 --> 03:36:29,269
in scale right um us you know sort of
like data center power consumption has

12082
03:36:29,269 --> 03:36:29,279
like data center power consumption has
 

12083
03:36:29,279 --> 03:36:31,269
like data center power consumption has
been slowly On The Rise and it's gone up

12084
03:36:31,269 --> 03:36:31,279
been slowly On The Rise and it's gone up
 

12085
03:36:31,279 --> 03:36:33,590
been slowly On The Rise and it's gone up
to 23% even through the cloud computing

12086
03:36:33,590 --> 03:36:33,600
to 23% even through the cloud computing
 

12087
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:35,590
to 23% even through the cloud computing
Revolution right data center consumption

12088
03:36:35,590 --> 03:36:35,600
Revolution right data center consumption
 

12089
03:36:35,600 --> 03:36:37,830
Revolution right data center consumption
as a percentage of total us and and

12090
03:36:37,830 --> 03:36:37,840
as a percentage of total us and and
 

12091
03:36:37,840 --> 03:36:39,349
as a percentage of total us and and
that's been over decades right of data

12092
03:36:39,349 --> 03:36:39,359
that's been over decades right of data
 

12093
03:36:39,359 --> 03:36:41,189
that's been over decades right of data
centers Etc it's been climbing climbing

12094
03:36:41,189 --> 03:36:41,199
centers Etc it's been climbing climbing
 

12095
03:36:41,199 --> 03:36:44,389

slowly but now 2 to 3% now by the end of

12096
03:36:44,389 --> 03:36:44,399
slowly but now 2 to 3% now by the end of
 

12097
03:36:44,399 --> 03:36:46,429

this decade it's like even even under

12098
03:36:46,429 --> 03:36:46,439
this decade it's like even even under
 

12099
03:36:46,439 --> 03:36:48,550
this decade it's like even even under
like you know when I say like 10% a lot

12100
03:36:48,550 --> 03:36:48,560
like you know when I say like 10% a lot
 

12101
03:36:48,560 --> 03:36:50,429
like you know when I say like 10% a lot
of people that are traditionally uh by

12102
03:36:50,429 --> 03:36:50,439
of people that are traditionally uh by
 

12103
03:36:50,439 --> 03:36:53,790
of people that are traditionally uh by
like 2028 2030 people traditionally non

12104
03:36:53,790 --> 03:36:53,800
like 2028 2030 people traditionally non
 

12105
03:36:53,800 --> 03:36:55,670
like 2028 2030 people traditionally non
a uh traditional data center people like

12106
03:36:55,670 --> 03:36:55,680
a uh traditional data center people like
 

12107
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:57,950
a uh traditional data center people like
that's nuts but then like people who are

12108
03:36:57,950 --> 03:36:57,960
that's nuts but then like people who are
 

12109
03:36:57,960 --> 03:36:59,630
that's nuts but then like people who are
in like AI who have like really looked

12110
03:36:59,630 --> 03:36:59,640
in like AI who have like really looked
 

12111
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:01,229
in like AI who have like really looked
at this at like the anthropics and open

12112
03:37:01,229 --> 03:37:01,239
at this at like the anthropics and open
 

12113
03:37:01,239 --> 03:37:02,469
at this at like the anthropics and open
AI they're like that's not enough and

12114
03:37:02,469 --> 03:37:02,479
AI they're like that's not enough and
 

12115
03:37:02,479 --> 03:37:05,950
AI they're like that's not enough and
I'm like okay but like you know this is

12116
03:37:05,950 --> 03:37:05,960
I'm like okay but like you know this is
 

12117
03:37:05,960 --> 03:37:07,910
I'm like okay but like you know this is
this is both through uh globally

12118
03:37:07,910 --> 03:37:07,920
this is both through uh globally
 

12119
03:37:07,920 --> 03:37:09,630
this is both through uh globally
distributed uh and or distributed

12120
03:37:09,630 --> 03:37:09,640
distributed uh and or distributed
 

12121
03:37:09,640 --> 03:37:10,870
distributed uh and or distributed
throughout the us as well as like

12122
03:37:10,870 --> 03:37:10,880
throughout the us as well as like
 

12123
03:37:10,880 --> 03:37:12,670
throughout the us as well as like
centralized clusters right the the

12124
03:37:12,670 --> 03:37:12,680
centralized clusters right the the
 

12125
03:37:12,680 --> 03:37:14,309
centralized clusters right the the
distributed throughout the US is is

12126
03:37:14,309 --> 03:37:14,319
distributed throughout the US is is
 

12127
03:37:14,319 --> 03:37:16,070
distributed throughout the US is is
exciting and it's the bulk of it right

12128
03:37:16,070 --> 03:37:16,080
exciting and it's the bulk of it right
 

12129
03:37:16,080 --> 03:37:19,670
exciting and it's the bulk of it right
like hey you know uh openi or you know

12130
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:19,680
like hey you know uh openi or you know
 

12131
03:37:19,680 --> 03:37:23,269
like hey you know uh openi or you know
say meta is adding a gwatt right um but

12132
03:37:23,269 --> 03:37:23,279
say meta is adding a gwatt right um but
 

12133
03:37:23,279 --> 03:37:24,750
say meta is adding a gwatt right um but
most of it is distributed through the US

12134
03:37:24,750 --> 03:37:24,760
most of it is distributed through the US
 

12135
03:37:24,760 --> 03:37:26,349
most of it is distributed through the US
for inference and all these other things

12136
03:37:26,349 --> 03:37:26,359
for inference and all these other things
 

12137
03:37:26,359 --> 03:37:28,670
for inference and all these other things
right so maybe we should lay out what a

12138
03:37:28,670 --> 03:37:28,680
right so maybe we should lay out what a
 

12139
03:37:28,680 --> 03:37:31,990
right so maybe we should lay out what a
what a cluster is so uh you know does

12140
03:37:31,990 --> 03:37:32,000
what a cluster is so uh you know does
 

12141
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:34,670
what a cluster is so uh you know does
this include AWS maybe it's it's good to

12142
03:37:34,670 --> 03:37:34,680
this include AWS maybe it's it's good to
 

12143
03:37:34,680 --> 03:37:35,790
this include AWS maybe it's it's good to
talk about the different kinds of

12144
03:37:35,790 --> 03:37:35,800
talk about the different kinds of
 

12145
03:37:35,800 --> 03:37:37,229
talk about the different kinds of
clusters and what you mean by Mega

12146
03:37:37,229 --> 03:37:37,239
clusters and what you mean by Mega
 

12147
03:37:37,239 --> 03:37:39,469
clusters and what you mean by Mega
clusters and what's a GPU and what's a

12148
03:37:39,469 --> 03:37:39,479
clusters and what's a GPU and what's a
 

12149
03:37:39,479 --> 03:37:42,389
clusters and what's a GPU and what's a
computer and what kid not that far back

12150
03:37:42,389 --> 03:37:42,399
computer and what kid not that far back
 

12151
03:37:42,399 --> 03:37:44,550
computer and what kid not that far back
but yeah so like what do we mean by the

12152
03:37:44,550 --> 03:37:44,560
but yeah so like what do we mean by the
 

12153
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:46,590
but yeah so like what do we mean by the
Clusters I thought I was about to do the

12154
03:37:46,590 --> 03:37:46,600
Clusters I thought I was about to do the
 

12155
03:37:46,600 --> 03:37:48,750
Clusters I thought I was about to do the
Apple ad right what's a

12156
03:37:48,750 --> 03:37:48,760
Apple ad right what's a
 

12157
03:37:48,760 --> 03:37:51,670
Apple ad right what's a
computer so so traditionally data

12158
03:37:51,670 --> 03:37:51,680
computer so so traditionally data
 

12159
03:37:51,680 --> 03:37:54,229
computer so so traditionally data
centers and data center tasks have been

12160
03:37:54,229 --> 03:37:54,239
centers and data center tasks have been
 

12161
03:37:54,239 --> 03:37:57,269
centers and data center tasks have been
a distributed systems problem that is uh

12162
03:37:57,269 --> 03:37:57,279
a distributed systems problem that is uh
 

12163
03:37:57,279 --> 03:37:58,830
a distributed systems problem that is uh
capable of being spread very far and

12164
03:37:58,830 --> 03:37:58,840
capable of being spread very far and
 

12165
03:37:58,840 --> 03:38:02,269
capable of being spread very far and
widely right I.E I send a request to

12166
03:38:02,269 --> 03:38:02,279
widely right I.E I send a request to
 

12167
03:38:02,279 --> 03:38:03,790
widely right I.E I send a request to
Google it's gets routed to a data center

12168
03:38:03,790 --> 03:38:03,800
Google it's gets routed to a data center
 

12169
03:38:03,800 --> 03:38:06,349
Google it's gets routed to a data center
somewhat close to me um it does whatever

12170
03:38:06,349 --> 03:38:06,359
somewhat close to me um it does whatever
 

12171
03:38:06,359 --> 03:38:08,309
somewhat close to me um it does whatever
search ranking recommendation sends a

12172
03:38:08,309 --> 03:38:08,319
search ranking recommendation sends a
 

12173
03:38:08,319 --> 03:38:11,630
search ranking recommendation sends a
result back right um the nature of the

12174
03:38:11,630 --> 03:38:11,640
result back right um the nature of the
 

12175
03:38:11,640 --> 03:38:14,150
result back right um the nature of the
task is changing rapidly in that the

12176
03:38:14,150 --> 03:38:14,160
task is changing rapidly in that the
 

12177
03:38:14,160 --> 03:38:15,670
task is changing rapidly in that the
task there's two tasks that people are

12178
03:38:15,670 --> 03:38:15,680
task there's two tasks that people are
 

12179
03:38:15,680 --> 03:38:16,830
task there's two tasks that people are
really focused on now right it's not

12180
03:38:16,830 --> 03:38:16,840
really focused on now right it's not
 

12181
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:18,710
really focused on now right it's not
database access it's not serve me the

12182
03:38:18,710 --> 03:38:18,720
database access it's not serve me the
 

12183
03:38:18,720 --> 03:38:20,950
database access it's not serve me the
right page serve me the right ad it's

12184
03:38:20,950 --> 03:38:20,960
right page serve me the right ad it's
 

12185
03:38:20,960 --> 03:38:23,750
right page serve me the right ad it's
now a inference and inference is

12186
03:38:23,750 --> 03:38:23,760
now a inference and inference is
 

12187
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:24,990
now a inference and inference is
dramatically different from traditional

12188
03:38:24,990 --> 03:38:25,000
dramatically different from traditional
 

12189
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:26,309
dramatically different from traditional
distributed systems but it looks a lot

12190
03:38:26,309 --> 03:38:26,319
distributed systems but it looks a lot
 

12191
03:38:26,319 --> 03:38:28,070
distributed systems but it looks a lot
more simple simp similar and then

12192
03:38:28,070 --> 03:38:28,080
more simple simp similar and then
 

12193
03:38:28,080 --> 03:38:30,070
more simple simp similar and then
there's training right the train

12194
03:38:30,070 --> 03:38:30,080
there's training right the train
 

12195
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:31,910
there's training right the train
inference side is still like hey I'm

12196
03:38:31,910 --> 03:38:31,920
inference side is still like hey I'm
 

12197
03:38:31,920 --> 03:38:33,870
inference side is still like hey I'm
going to put you know thousands of gpus

12198
03:38:33,870 --> 03:38:33,880
going to put you know thousands of gpus
 

12199
03:38:33,880 --> 03:38:36,349
going to put you know thousands of gpus
in in you know blocks all around these

12200
03:38:36,349 --> 03:38:36,359
in in you know blocks all around these
 

12201
03:38:36,359 --> 03:38:38,229
in in you know blocks all around these
data centers I'm going to run models on

12202
03:38:38,229 --> 03:38:38,239
data centers I'm going to run models on
 

12203
03:38:38,239 --> 03:38:40,269
data centers I'm going to run models on
them you know user submits a request

12204
03:38:40,269 --> 03:38:40,279
them you know user submits a request
 

12205
03:38:40,279 --> 03:38:42,349
them you know user submits a request
gets kicked off or hey my service you

12206
03:38:42,349 --> 03:38:42,359
gets kicked off or hey my service you
 

12207
03:38:42,359 --> 03:38:44,110
gets kicked off or hey my service you
know they submit a request to my service

12208
03:38:44,110 --> 03:38:44,120
know they submit a request to my service
 

12209
03:38:44,120 --> 03:38:45,070
know they submit a request to my service
right they're on word and they're like

12210
03:38:45,070 --> 03:38:45,080
right they're on word and they're like
 

12211
03:38:45,080 --> 03:38:46,189
right they're on word and they're like
oh yeah help help me co-pilot and it

12212
03:38:46,189 --> 03:38:46,199
oh yeah help help me co-pilot and it
 

12213
03:38:46,199 --> 03:38:47,990
oh yeah help help me co-pilot and it
starts kicks it off I'm on my windows

12214
03:38:47,990 --> 03:38:48,000
starts kicks it off I'm on my windows
 

12215
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:49,590
starts kicks it off I'm on my windows
co-pilot whatever Apple intelligence

12216
03:38:49,590 --> 03:38:49,600
co-pilot whatever Apple intelligence
 

12217
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:50,790
co-pilot whatever Apple intelligence
whatever it is it gets kicked off to a

12218
03:38:50,790 --> 03:38:50,800
whatever it is it gets kicked off to a
 

12219
03:38:50,800 --> 03:38:52,870
whatever it is it gets kicked off to a
data center right and that data center

12220
03:38:52,870 --> 03:38:52,880
data center right and that data center
 

12221
03:38:52,880 --> 03:38:54,710
data center right and that data center
does some work and sends it back that's

12222
03:38:54,710 --> 03:38:54,720
does some work and sends it back that's
 

12223
03:38:54,720 --> 03:38:57,150
does some work and sends it back that's
inference that is going to be the bulk

12224
03:38:57,150 --> 03:38:57,160
inference that is going to be the bulk
 

12225
03:38:57,160 --> 03:39:00,070
inference that is going to be the bulk
of compute but then you know that and

12226
03:39:00,070 --> 03:39:00,080
of compute but then you know that and
 

12227
03:39:00,080 --> 03:39:00,990
of compute but then you know that and
that's like you know there's thousands

12228
03:39:00,990 --> 03:39:01,000
that's like you know there's thousands
 

12229
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:02,429
that's like you know there's thousands
of data centers that we're tracking with

12230
03:39:02,429 --> 03:39:02,439
of data centers that we're tracking with
 

12231
03:39:02,439 --> 03:39:03,870
of data centers that we're tracking with
Like Satellites and like all these other

12232
03:39:03,870 --> 03:39:03,880
Like Satellites and like all these other
 

12233
03:39:03,880 --> 03:39:05,750
Like Satellites and like all these other
things and and those are the bulk of

12234
03:39:05,750 --> 03:39:05,760
things and and those are the bulk of
 

12235
03:39:05,760 --> 03:39:08,229
things and and those are the bulk of
what's being built but the scale of and

12236
03:39:08,229 --> 03:39:08,239
what's being built but the scale of and
 

12237
03:39:08,239 --> 03:39:09,550
what's being built but the scale of and
and and so that's like what's really

12238
03:39:09,550 --> 03:39:09,560
and and so that's like what's really
 

12239
03:39:09,560 --> 03:39:10,710
and and so that's like what's really
reshaping and that's what's getting

12240
03:39:10,710 --> 03:39:10,720
reshaping and that's what's getting
 

12241
03:39:10,720 --> 03:39:13,510
reshaping and that's what's getting
millions of gpus but the scale of the uh

12242
03:39:13,510 --> 03:39:13,520
millions of gpus but the scale of the uh
 

12243
03:39:13,520 --> 03:39:15,790
millions of gpus but the scale of the uh
largest cluster is also really important

12244
03:39:15,790 --> 03:39:15,800
largest cluster is also really important
 

12245
03:39:15,800 --> 03:39:18,550
largest cluster is also really important
right um when we look back at history

12246
03:39:18,550 --> 03:39:18,560
right um when we look back at history
 

12247
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:21,110
right um when we look back at history
right like you know or through through

12248
03:39:21,110 --> 03:39:21,120
right like you know or through through
 

12249
03:39:21,120 --> 03:39:23,510
right like you know or through through
the age of AI right like it was a really

12250
03:39:23,510 --> 03:39:23,520
the age of AI right like it was a really
 

12251
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:26,550
the age of AI right like it was a really
big deal when they did alexnet on I

12252
03:39:26,550 --> 03:39:26,560
big deal when they did alexnet on I
 

12253
03:39:26,560 --> 03:39:28,469
big deal when they did alexnet on I
think two gpus or four gpus I don't

12254
03:39:28,469 --> 03:39:28,479
think two gpus or four gpus I don't
 

12255
03:39:28,479 --> 03:39:30,309
think two gpus or four gpus I don't
remember it's a really big deal it's a

12256
03:39:30,309 --> 03:39:30,319
remember it's a really big deal it's a
 

12257
03:39:30,319 --> 03:39:32,070
remember it's a really big deal it's a
big deal because you use gpus it's a big

12258
03:39:32,070 --> 03:39:32,080
big deal because you use gpus it's a big
 

12259
03:39:32,080 --> 03:39:34,030
big deal because you use gpus it's a big
deal they used gpus um and they used

12260
03:39:34,030 --> 03:39:34,040
deal they used gpus um and they used
 

12261
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:35,790
deal they used gpus um and they used
multiple right but then over time it

12262
03:39:35,790 --> 03:39:35,800
multiple right but then over time it
 

12263
03:39:35,800 --> 03:39:38,429
multiple right but then over time it
scale has just been compounding right

12264
03:39:38,429 --> 03:39:38,439
scale has just been compounding right
 

12265
03:39:38,439 --> 03:39:40,590
scale has just been compounding right
and so when you skip forward to gpt3

12266
03:39:40,590 --> 03:39:40,600
and so when you skip forward to gpt3
 

12267
03:39:40,600 --> 03:39:44,750
and so when you skip forward to gpt3
then gp4 gp4 20,000 a100 gpus

12268
03:39:44,750 --> 03:39:44,760
then gp4 gp4 20,000 a100 gpus
 

12269
03:39:44,760 --> 03:39:47,110
then gp4 gp4 20,000 a100 gpus
unprecedent Ed run right in terms of the

12270
03:39:47,110 --> 03:39:47,120
unprecedent Ed run right in terms of the
 

12271
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:48,630
unprecedent Ed run right in terms of the
size and the cost right couple hundred

12272
03:39:48,630 --> 03:39:48,640
size and the cost right couple hundred
 

12273
03:39:48,640 --> 03:39:51,070
size and the cost right couple hundred
million on a YOLO right a YOLO run for

12274
03:39:51,070 --> 03:39:51,080
million on a YOLO right a YOLO run for
 

12275
03:39:51,080 --> 03:39:53,030
million on a YOLO right a YOLO run for
GPD 4 and it and it yielded you know

12276
03:39:53,030 --> 03:39:53,040
GPD 4 and it and it yielded you know
 

12277
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:55,150
GPD 4 and it and it yielded you know
this magical Improvement that was like

12278
03:39:55,150 --> 03:39:55,160
this magical Improvement that was like
 

12279
03:39:55,160 --> 03:39:56,710
this magical Improvement that was like
perfectly in line with what was

12280
03:39:56,710 --> 03:39:56,720
perfectly in line with what was
 

12281
03:39:56,720 --> 03:39:58,510
perfectly in line with what was
experimented and just like a log scale

12282
03:39:58,510 --> 03:39:58,520
experimented and just like a log scale
 

12283
03:39:58,520 --> 03:40:00,189
experimented and just like a log scale
right oh yeah they have that plot from

12284
03:40:00,189 --> 03:40:00,199
right oh yeah they have that plot from
 

12285
03:40:00,199 --> 03:40:02,830
right oh yeah they have that plot from
the paper the technical per the scaling

12286
03:40:02,830 --> 03:40:02,840
the paper the technical per the scaling
 

12287
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:04,790
the paper the technical per the scaling
laws were perfect right but that's not a

12288
03:40:04,790 --> 03:40:04,800
laws were perfect right but that's not a
 

12289
03:40:04,800 --> 03:40:07,910
laws were perfect right but that's not a
crazy number right 20,000 A1 100s uh

12290
03:40:07,910 --> 03:40:07,920
crazy number right 20,000 A1 100s uh
 

12291
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:10,630
crazy number right 20,000 A1 100s uh
roughly each GPU is consuming 400 watts

12292
03:40:10,630 --> 03:40:10,640
roughly each GPU is consuming 400 watts
 

12293
03:40:10,640 --> 03:40:11,750
roughly each GPU is consuming 400 watts
uh and then when you add in the whole

12294
03:40:11,750 --> 03:40:11,760
uh and then when you add in the whole
 

12295
03:40:11,760 --> 03:40:14,349
uh and then when you add in the whole
server right everything um it's like 15

12296
03:40:14,349 --> 03:40:14,359
server right everything um it's like 15
 

12297
03:40:14,359 --> 03:40:17,389
server right everything um it's like 15
to 20 megawatts up power right uh you

12298
03:40:17,389 --> 03:40:17,399
to 20 megawatts up power right uh you
 

12299
03:40:17,399 --> 03:40:19,469
to 20 megawatts up power right uh you
know you know maybe you could look up

12300
03:40:19,469 --> 03:40:19,479
know you know maybe you could look up
 

12301
03:40:19,479 --> 03:40:21,030
know you know maybe you could look up
what the power of consumption of a human

12302
03:40:21,030 --> 03:40:21,040
what the power of consumption of a human
 

12303
03:40:21,040 --> 03:40:22,070
what the power of consumption of a human
a person is because the numbers are

12304
03:40:22,070 --> 03:40:22,080
a person is because the numbers are
 

12305
03:40:22,080 --> 03:40:24,269
a person is because the numbers are
going to get silly but like that 15 to

12306
03:40:24,269 --> 03:40:24,279
going to get silly but like that 15 to
 

12307
03:40:24,279 --> 03:40:25,910
going to get silly but like that 15 to
20 megawatts was standard data center

12308
03:40:25,910 --> 03:40:25,920
20 megawatts was standard data center
 

12309
03:40:25,920 --> 03:40:27,349
20 megawatts was standard data center
size it was just unprecedented that was

12310
03:40:27,349 --> 03:40:27,359
size it was just unprecedented that was
 

12311
03:40:27,359 --> 03:40:30,030
size it was just unprecedented that was
all gpus running one Tas 20 watts was a

12312
03:40:30,030 --> 03:40:30,040
all gpus running one Tas 20 watts was a
 

12313
03:40:30,040 --> 03:40:33,870
all gpus running one Tas 20 watts was a
toaster toaster is like a similar power

12314
03:40:33,870 --> 03:40:33,880
toaster toaster is like a similar power
 

12315
03:40:33,880 --> 03:40:36,269
toaster toaster is like a similar power
consumption to an a100 Right h100 comes

12316
03:40:36,269 --> 03:40:36,279
consumption to an a100 Right h100 comes
 

12317
03:40:36,279 --> 03:40:37,670
consumption to an a100 Right h100 comes
around they increase the power from like

12318
03:40:37,670 --> 03:40:37,680
around they increase the power from like
 

12319
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:40,189
around they increase the power from like
400 to 700 watts and that's just per GPU

12320
03:40:40,189 --> 03:40:40,199
400 to 700 watts and that's just per GPU
 

12321
03:40:40,199 --> 03:40:41,189
400 to 700 watts and that's just per GPU
and then there's all the associated

12322
03:40:41,189 --> 03:40:41,199
and then there's all the associated
 

12323
03:40:41,199 --> 03:40:43,150
and then there's all the associated
stuff around it so once you count all

12324
03:40:43,150 --> 03:40:43,160
stuff around it so once you count all
 

12325
03:40:43,160 --> 03:40:45,389
stuff around it so once you count all
that it's roughly like 1,200 to 1400

12326
03:40:45,389 --> 03:40:45,399
that it's roughly like 1,200 to 1400
 

12327
03:40:45,399 --> 03:40:47,550
that it's roughly like 1,200 to 1400
Watts for everything networking CPUs

12328
03:40:47,550 --> 03:40:47,560
Watts for everything networking CPUs
 

12329
03:40:47,560 --> 03:40:49,389
Watts for everything networking CPUs
memory blah blah blah so we should also

12330
03:40:49,389 --> 03:40:49,399
memory blah blah blah so we should also
 

12331
03:40:49,399 --> 03:40:51,429
memory blah blah blah so we should also
say so what's

12332
03:40:51,429 --> 03:40:51,439
say so what's
 

12333
03:40:51,439 --> 03:40:53,990
say so what's
required you said power so a lot of

12334
03:40:53,990 --> 03:40:54,000
required you said power so a lot of
 

12335
03:40:54,000 --> 03:40:55,950
required you said power so a lot of
power is required a lot of heat is

12336
03:40:55,950 --> 03:40:55,960
power is required a lot of heat is
 

12337
03:40:55,960 --> 03:40:59,910
power is required a lot of heat is
generated so cooling is required and uh

12338
03:40:59,910 --> 03:40:59,920
generated so cooling is required and uh
 

12339
03:40:59,920 --> 03:41:01,429
generated so cooling is required and uh
because there's a lot of gpus that have

12340
03:41:01,429 --> 03:41:01,439
because there's a lot of gpus that have
 

12341
03:41:01,439 --> 03:41:04,070
because there's a lot of gpus that have
to be or CPUs or whatever they have to

12342
03:41:04,070 --> 03:41:04,080
to be or CPUs or whatever they have to
 

12343
03:41:04,080 --> 03:41:05,469
to be or CPUs or whatever they have to
be connected so there's a lot of

12344
03:41:05,469 --> 03:41:05,479
be connected so there's a lot of
 

12345
03:41:05,479 --> 03:41:07,710
be connected so there's a lot of
networking yeah right yeah so I think

12346
03:41:07,710 --> 03:41:07,720
networking yeah right yeah so I think
 

12347
03:41:07,720 --> 03:41:10,110
networking yeah right yeah so I think
yeah sorry for uh skipping past that and

12348
03:41:10,110 --> 03:41:10,120
yeah sorry for uh skipping past that and
 

12349
03:41:10,120 --> 03:41:11,349
yeah sorry for uh skipping past that and
then the data center itself is like

12350
03:41:11,349 --> 03:41:11,359
then the data center itself is like
 

12351
03:41:11,359 --> 03:41:13,269
then the data center itself is like
complicated right but these are still

12352
03:41:13,269 --> 03:41:13,279
complicated right but these are still
 

12353
03:41:13,279 --> 03:41:15,990
complicated right but these are still
standardized data centers for gp4 scale

12354
03:41:15,990 --> 03:41:16,000
standardized data centers for gp4 scale
 

12355
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:18,510
standardized data centers for gp4 scale
right now we step forward to sort of

12356
03:41:18,510 --> 03:41:18,520
right now we step forward to sort of
 

12357
03:41:18,520 --> 03:41:20,030
right now we step forward to sort of
what is the scale of clusters that

12358
03:41:20,030 --> 03:41:20,040
what is the scale of clusters that
 

12359
03:41:20,040 --> 03:41:22,550
what is the scale of clusters that
people have built last year right and it

12360
03:41:22,550 --> 03:41:22,560
people have built last year right and it
 

12361
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:25,469
people have built last year right and it
ranges widely right it ranges from like

12362
03:41:25,469 --> 03:41:25,479
ranges widely right it ranges from like
 

12363
03:41:25,479 --> 03:41:27,149
ranges widely right it ranges from like
hey these are standard data centers and

12364
03:41:27,149 --> 03:41:27,159
hey these are standard data centers and
 

12365
03:41:27,159 --> 03:41:28,630
hey these are standard data centers and
we're just using multiple of them and

12366
03:41:28,630 --> 03:41:28,640
we're just using multiple of them and
 

12367
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:30,269
we're just using multiple of them and
connecting them together really with a

12368
03:41:30,269 --> 03:41:30,279
connecting them together really with a
 

12369
03:41:30,279 --> 03:41:31,510
connecting them together really with a
ton of fiber between them a lot of

12370
03:41:31,510 --> 03:41:31,520
ton of fiber between them a lot of
 

12371
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:33,550
ton of fiber between them a lot of
networking Etc that's what open Ai and

12372
03:41:33,550 --> 03:41:33,560
networking Etc that's what open Ai and
 

12373
03:41:33,560 --> 03:41:35,269

Microsoft did in Arizona right and so

12374
03:41:35,269 --> 03:41:35,279
Microsoft did in Arizona right and so
 

12375
03:41:35,279 --> 03:41:37,429
Microsoft did in Arizona right and so
they have a you know 100,000 gpus right

12376
03:41:37,429 --> 03:41:37,439
they have a you know 100,000 gpus right
 

12377
03:41:37,439 --> 03:41:38,830
they have a you know 100,000 gpus right
meta similar thing they took their

12378
03:41:38,830 --> 03:41:38,840
meta similar thing they took their
 

12379
03:41:38,840 --> 03:41:40,790
meta similar thing they took their
standard existing data center design um

12380
03:41:40,790 --> 03:41:40,800
standard existing data center design um
 

12381
03:41:40,800 --> 03:41:42,229
standard existing data center design um
and it looks like an h and they

12382
03:41:42,229 --> 03:41:42,239
and it looks like an h and they
 

12383
03:41:42,239 --> 03:41:44,630
and it looks like an h and they
connected multiple of them together um

12384
03:41:44,630 --> 03:41:44,640
connected multiple of them together um
 

12385
03:41:44,640 --> 03:41:46,349
connected multiple of them together um
and you know they got to they first did

12386
03:41:46,349 --> 03:41:46,359
and you know they got to they first did
 

12387
03:41:46,359 --> 03:41:49,990
and you know they got to they first did
16,000 gpus uh 24,000 gpus total only 16

12388
03:41:49,990 --> 03:41:50,000
16,000 gpus uh 24,000 gpus total only 16
 

12389
03:41:50,000 --> 03:41:51,149
16,000 gpus uh 24,000 gpus total only 16
of them thousand of them were running on

12390
03:41:51,149 --> 03:41:51,159
of them thousand of them were running on
 

12391
03:41:51,159 --> 03:41:52,590
of them thousand of them were running on
the training run because gpus are very

12392
03:41:52,590 --> 03:41:52,600
the training run because gpus are very
 

12393
03:41:52,600 --> 03:41:54,149
the training run because gpus are very
unreliable so they need to have spares

12394
03:41:54,149 --> 03:41:54,159
unreliable so they need to have spares
 

12395
03:41:54,159 --> 03:41:55,950
unreliable so they need to have spares
to like swap in and out all the way to

12396
03:41:55,950 --> 03:41:55,960
to like swap in and out all the way to
 

12397
03:41:55,960 --> 03:41:57,550
to like swap in and out all the way to
like now 100,000 gpus that they're

12398
03:41:57,550 --> 03:41:57,560
like now 100,000 gpus that they're
 

12399
03:41:57,560 --> 03:41:59,590
like now 100,000 gpus that they're
training on llama 4 on currently right

12400
03:41:59,590 --> 03:41:59,600
training on llama 4 on currently right
 

12401
03:41:59,600 --> 03:42:02,389
training on llama 4 on currently right
like 128,000 or so right this is you

12402
03:42:02,389 --> 03:42:02,399
like 128,000 or so right this is you
 

12403
03:42:02,399 --> 03:42:05,990
like 128,000 or so right this is you
know think about 100,000 gpus um with

12404
03:42:05,990 --> 03:42:06,000
know think about 100,000 gpus um with
 

12405
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:08,750
know think about 100,000 gpus um with
roughly 1,400 Watts a piece that's

12406
03:42:08,750 --> 03:42:08,760
roughly 1,400 Watts a piece that's
 

12407
03:42:08,760 --> 03:42:10,870
roughly 1,400 Watts a piece that's
that's that's 140 megawatts 150

12408
03:42:10,870 --> 03:42:10,880
that's that's 140 megawatts 150
 

12409
03:42:10,880 --> 03:42:13,229
that's that's 140 megawatts 150
megawatts right for 128 right so you're

12410
03:42:13,229 --> 03:42:13,239
megawatts right for 128 right so you're
 

12411
03:42:13,239 --> 03:42:15,309
megawatts right for 128 right so you're
talking about you've jumped from 15 to

12412
03:42:15,309 --> 03:42:15,319
talking about you've jumped from 15 to
 

12413
03:42:15,319 --> 03:42:17,750
talking about you've jumped from 15 to
megawatts to 10x you know almost 10x

12414
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:17,760
megawatts to 10x you know almost 10x
 

12415
03:42:17,760 --> 03:42:19,950
megawatts to 10x you know almost 10x
that number 9x that number to 150

12416
03:42:19,950 --> 03:42:19,960
that number 9x that number to 150

later right but then he he bent Heaven
and Hell to get his data center up and

12432
03:42:37,149 --> 03:42:37,159
and Hell to get his data center up and
 

12433
03:42:37,159 --> 03:42:38,429
and Hell to get his data center up and
get the largest cluster in the world

12434
03:42:38,429 --> 03:42:38,439
get the largest cluster in the world
 

12435
03:42:38,439 --> 03:42:41,309
get the largest cluster in the world
right which is 200,000 gpus um and and

12436
03:42:41,309 --> 03:42:41,319
right which is 200,000 gpus um and and
 

12437
03:42:41,319 --> 03:42:42,910
right which is 200,000 gpus um and and
and he did that he bought a factory in

12438
03:42:42,910 --> 03:42:42,920
and he did that he bought a factory in
 

12439
03:42:42,920 --> 03:42:45,670
and he did that he bought a factory in
Memphis uh he up upgrading the

12440
03:42:45,670 --> 03:42:45,680
Memphis uh he up upgrading the
 

12441
03:42:45,680 --> 03:42:47,110
Memphis uh he up upgrading the
substation at the same time he's got a

12442
03:42:47,110 --> 03:42:47,120
substation at the same time he's got a
 

12443
03:42:47,120 --> 03:42:48,790
substation at the same time he's got a
bunch of mobile power generation a bunch

12444
03:42:48,790 --> 03:42:48,800
bunch of mobile power generation a bunch
 

12445
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:51,269
bunch of mobile power generation a bunch
of single cycle combine he tapped the

12446
03:42:51,269 --> 03:42:51,279
of single cycle combine he tapped the
 

12447
03:42:51,279 --> 03:42:52,790
of single cycle combine he tapped the
natural gas line that's right next to

12448
03:42:52,790 --> 03:42:52,800
natural gas line that's right next to
 

12449
03:42:52,800 --> 03:42:54,550
natural gas line that's right next to
the factory and he's just pulling a ton

12450
03:42:54,550 --> 03:42:54,560
the factory and he's just pulling a ton
 

12451
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:56,630
the factory and he's just pulling a ton
of gas burning gas he's generating all

12452
03:42:56,630 --> 03:42:56,640
of gas burning gas he's generating all
 

12453
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:59,110
of gas burning gas he's generating all
this power he's in a factory in an old

12454
03:42:59,110 --> 03:42:59,120
this power he's in a factory in an old
 

12455
03:42:59,120 --> 03:43:00,349
this power he's in a factory in an old
Appliance Factory that's shut down and

12456
03:43:00,349 --> 03:43:00,359
Appliance Factory that's shut down and
 

12457
03:43:00,359 --> 03:43:02,149
Appliance Factory that's shut down and
moved to China long ago right like you

12458
03:43:02,149 --> 03:43:02,159
moved to China long ago right like you
 

12459
03:43:02,159 --> 03:43:04,710
moved to China long ago right like you
know and and and he's got 200,000 gpus

12460
03:43:04,710 --> 03:43:04,720
know and and and he's got 200,000 gpus
 

12461
03:43:04,720 --> 03:43:06,870
know and and and he's got 200,000 gpus
in it and now what's the next scale

12462
03:43:06,870 --> 03:43:06,880
in it and now what's the next scale
 

12463
03:43:06,880 --> 03:43:08,110
in it and now what's the next scale
right like all all the hypers scalers

12464
03:43:08,110 --> 03:43:08,120
right like all all the hypers scalers
 

12465
03:43:08,120 --> 03:43:10,149
right like all all the hypers scalers
have done this now the next scale is is

12466
03:43:10,149 --> 03:43:10,159
have done this now the next scale is is
 

12467
03:43:10,159 --> 03:43:11,550
have done this now the next scale is is
is something that's even bigger right

12468
03:43:11,550 --> 03:43:11,560
is something that's even bigger right
 

12469
03:43:11,560 --> 03:43:13,189
is something that's even bigger right
and so you know Elon just to stick on

12470
03:43:13,189 --> 03:43:13,199
and so you know Elon just to stick on
 

12471
03:43:13,199 --> 03:43:15,349
and so you know Elon just to stick on
the topic he's he's building his own

12472
03:43:15,349 --> 03:43:15,359
the topic he's he's building his own
 

12473
03:43:15,359 --> 03:43:17,429
the topic he's he's building his own
natural gas plant like a proper one

12474
03:43:17,429 --> 03:43:17,439
natural gas plant like a proper one
 

12475
03:43:17,439 --> 03:43:20,229
natural gas plant like a proper one
right next door he's he's deploying tons

12476
03:43:20,229 --> 03:43:20,239
right next door he's he's deploying tons
 

12477
03:43:20,239 --> 03:43:22,229
right next door he's he's deploying tons
of Tesla mega pack batteries to make the

12478
03:43:22,229 --> 03:43:22,239
of Tesla mega pack batteries to make the
 

12479
03:43:22,239 --> 03:43:24,229
of Tesla mega pack batteries to make the
power more smooth and all sorts of other

12480
03:43:24,229 --> 03:43:24,239
power more smooth and all sorts of other
 

12481
03:43:24,239 --> 03:43:26,469
power more smooth and all sorts of other
things he's got like industrial chillers

12482
03:43:26,469 --> 03:43:26,479
things he's got like industrial chillers
 

12483
03:43:26,479 --> 03:43:27,950
things he's got like industrial chillers
to cool the water down because he's

12484
03:43:27,950 --> 03:43:27,960
to cool the water down because he's
 

12485
03:43:27,960 --> 03:43:30,349
to cool the water down because he's
water cooling the chips um so all these

12486
03:43:30,349 --> 03:43:30,359
water cooling the chips um so all these
 

12487
03:43:30,359 --> 03:43:32,670
water cooling the chips um so all these
crazy things to uh get the Clusters

12488
03:43:32,670 --> 03:43:32,680
crazy things to uh get the Clusters
 

12489
03:43:32,680 --> 03:43:34,469
crazy things to uh get the Clusters
bigger and bigger um but when you look

12490
03:43:34,469 --> 03:43:34,479
bigger and bigger um but when you look
 

12491
03:43:34,479 --> 03:43:36,469
bigger and bigger um but when you look
at like say what open AI did with

12492
03:43:36,469 --> 03:43:36,479
at like say what open AI did with
 

12493
03:43:36,479 --> 03:43:40,590
at like say what open AI did with
Stargate that's that in Arizona in um in

12494
03:43:40,590 --> 03:43:40,600
Stargate that's that in Arizona in um in
 

12495
03:43:40,600 --> 03:43:42,590
Stargate that's that in Arizona in um in
abene Texas right uh what they've

12496
03:43:42,590 --> 03:43:42,600
abene Texas right uh what they've
 

12497
03:43:42,600 --> 03:43:44,110
abene Texas right uh what they've
announced at least right it's not built

12498
03:43:44,110 --> 03:43:44,120
announced at least right it's not built
 

12499
03:43:44,120 --> 03:43:45,110
announced at least right it's not built
right Elon says they don't have the

12500
03:43:45,110 --> 03:43:45,120
right Elon says they don't have the
 

12501
03:43:45,120 --> 03:43:46,830
right Elon says they don't have the
money you know there's some debates

12502
03:43:46,830 --> 03:43:46,840
money you know there's some debates
 

12503
03:43:46,840 --> 03:43:49,950
money you know there's some debates
about this um but at full scale at least

12504
03:43:49,950 --> 03:43:49,960
about this um but at full scale at least
 

12505
03:43:49,960 --> 03:43:51,229
about this um but at full scale at least
the first section is like definitely

12506
03:43:51,229 --> 03:43:51,239
the first section is like definitely
 

12507
03:43:51,239 --> 03:43:52,349
the first section is like definitely
money's accounted for but there's

12508
03:43:52,349 --> 03:43:52,359
money's accounted for but there's
 

12509
03:43:52,359 --> 03:43:54,149
money's accounted for but there's
multiple sections but full scale that

12510
03:43:54,149 --> 03:43:54,159
multiple sections but full scale that
 

12511
03:43:54,159 --> 03:43:56,750
multiple sections but full scale that
data center is going to be 2.2 gwatt

12512
03:43:56,750 --> 03:43:56,760
data center is going to be 2.2 gwatt
 

12513
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:59,469
data center is going to be 2.2 gwatt
right 2200 megawatts of power in and

12514
03:43:59,469 --> 03:43:59,479
right 2200 megawatts of power in and
 

12515
03:43:59,479 --> 03:44:03,590
right 2200 megawatts of power in and
roughly like 1.8 gaws or 1,800 uh Mega

12516
03:44:03,590 --> 03:44:03,600
roughly like 1.8 gaws or 1,800 uh Mega
 

12517
03:44:03,600 --> 03:44:05,910
roughly like 1.8 gaws or 1,800 uh Mega
uh yeah 1,00 megawatts of power

12518
03:44:05,910 --> 03:44:05,920
uh yeah 1,00 megawatts of power
 

12519
03:44:05,920 --> 03:44:08,630
uh yeah 1,00 megawatts of power
delivered to chips right now this is an

12520
03:44:08,630 --> 03:44:08,640
delivered to chips right now this is an
 

12521
03:44:08,640 --> 03:44:11,229
delivered to chips right now this is an
absurd scale 2.2 gws is like more than

12522
03:44:11,229 --> 03:44:11,239
absurd scale 2.2 gws is like more than
 

12523
03:44:11,239 --> 03:44:13,510
absurd scale 2.2 gws is like more than
most cities right you know to be clear

12524
03:44:13,510 --> 03:44:13,520
most cities right you know to be clear
 

12525
03:44:13,520 --> 03:44:16,229
most cities right you know to be clear
um and delivered to a single cluster

12526
03:44:16,229 --> 03:44:16,239
um and delivered to a single cluster
 

12527
03:44:16,239 --> 03:44:18,710
um and delivered to a single cluster
that's connected to do training right um

12528
03:44:18,710 --> 03:44:18,720
that's connected to do training right um
 

12529
03:44:18,720 --> 03:44:20,189
that's connected to do training right um
to train these models to do both the

12530
03:44:20,189 --> 03:44:20,199
to train these models to do both the
 

12531
03:44:20,199 --> 03:44:21,550
to train these models to do both the

this stuff right this is insane it is
 

12535
03:44:24,199 --> 03:44:25,590
this stuff right this is insane it is
what is a nuclear power plant again and

12536
03:44:25,590 --> 03:44:25,600
what is a nuclear power plant again and
 

12537
03:44:25,600 --> 03:44:27,229
what is a nuclear power plant again and
everyone is doing this right everyone is

doing this right Meta Meta and Louisiana
 

12541
03:44:29,880 --> 03:44:31,790
doing this right Meta Meta and Louisiana
right they're building two natural gas

12542
03:44:31,790 --> 03:44:31,800
right they're building two natural gas
 

12543
03:44:31,800 --> 03:44:33,950
right they're building two natural gas
plants massive ones uh and they're and

gigawatt data centers right um to to

12560
03:44:52,550 --> 03:44:52,560
gigawatt data centers right um to to
 

12561
03:44:52,560 --> 03:44:54,950
gigawatt data centers right um to to
build this out because they they think

12562
03:44:54,950 --> 03:44:54,960
build this out because they they think
 

12563
03:44:54,960 --> 03:44:57,269
build this out because they they think
that yeah if I if I now have you know

12564
03:44:57,269 --> 03:44:57,279
that yeah if I if I now have you know
 

12565
03:44:57,279 --> 03:44:58,670
that yeah if I if I now have you know
obviously pre-training scaling is going

12566
03:44:58,670 --> 03:44:58,680
obviously pre-training scaling is going
 

12567
03:44:58,680 --> 03:45:00,229
obviously pre-training scaling is going
to continue but to some extent but then

12568
03:45:00,229 --> 03:45:00,239
to continue but to some extent but then
 

12569
03:45:00,239 --> 03:45:01,510
to continue but to some extent but then
also all this post trining stuff where

12570
03:45:01,510 --> 03:45:01,520
also all this post trining stuff where
 

12571
03:45:01,520 --> 03:45:03,590
also all this post trining stuff where
you have RL sandbox for computer use or

where they're going to and all these
 

12577
03:45:06,040 --> 03:45:07,670
where they're going to and all these
verif viable domains where they just

12597
03:45:24,120 --> 03:45:26,189
don't get 10x better model right you get
a diminishing returns but also you get

12598
03:45:26,189 --> 03:45:26,199
a diminishing returns but also you get
 

12599
03:45:26,199 --> 03:45:27,590
a diminishing returns but also you get
efficiency improvements so you bend the

buy this nuclear power plant Talon um

12612
03:45:40,870 --> 03:45:40,880
buy this nuclear power plant Talon um
 

12613
03:45:40,880 --> 03:45:42,269
buy this nuclear power plant Talon um
and if you look at Talon stock it's just

12614
03:45:42,269 --> 03:45:42,279
and if you look at Talon stock it's just
 

12615
03:45:42,279 --> 03:45:44,590
and if you look at Talon stock it's just
like skyrocketing and um you know like

03:45:44,590 --> 03:45:44,600
like skyrocketing and um you know like
 

12617
03:45:44,600 --> 03:45:46,149

they're build a massive multi- gwatt
 

12619
03:45:46,159 --> 03:45:47,349
they're build a massive multi- gwatt
data center there and you know you just

12620
03:45:47,349 --> 03:45:47,359
data center there and you know you just
 

12621
03:45:47,359 --> 03:45:48,950
data center there and you know you just
go down the list there's so many

12622
03:45:48,950 --> 03:45:48,960
go down the list there's so many
 

12623
03:45:48,960 --> 03:45:50,870
go down the list there's so many
ramifications interesting thing is like

12624
03:45:50,870 --> 03:45:50,880
ramifications interesting thing is like
 

12625
03:45:50,880 --> 03:45:53,149
ramifications interesting thing is like
certain regions of the US transmitting

12626

certain regions of the US transmitting
 

12627
03:45:53,159 --> 03:45:55,790
certain regions of the US transmitting
power cost more than actually generating

12628
03:45:55,790 --> 03:45:55,800
power cost more than actually generating
 

12629
03:45:55,800 --> 03:45:58,389
power cost more than actually generating
it right because the grid is so slow to

12630
03:45:58,389 --> 03:45:58,399
it right because the grid is so slow to
 

12631
03:45:58,399 --> 03:46:00,110
it right because the grid is so slow to
build and the demand for power and the

12632
03:46:00,110 --> 03:46:00,120
build and the demand for power and the
 

12633
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:02,309
build and the demand for power and the
ability to build power and like ramping

12634
03:46:02,309 --> 03:46:02,319
ability to build power and like ramping
 

12635
03:46:02,319 --> 03:46:03,830
ability to build power and like ramping
on a natural gas plant or even a coal

12636
03:46:03,830 --> 03:46:03,840
on a natural gas plant or even a coal
 

12637
03:46:03,840 --> 03:46:05,790
on a natural gas plant or even a coal
plant is like easy enough to do but like

12638
03:46:05,790 --> 03:46:05,800
plant is like easy enough to do but like
 

12639
03:46:05,800 --> 03:46:07,269
plant is like easy enough to do but like
transmitting the power is really hard so

12640
03:46:07,269 --> 03:46:07,279
transmitting the power is really hard so
 

12641
03:46:07,279 --> 03:46:09,990
transmitting the power is really hard so
in some parts of the US like in Virginia

12642
03:46:09,990 --> 03:46:10,000
in some parts of the US like in Virginia
 

12643
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:11,630
in some parts of the US like in Virginia
it cost more to transmit power than it

12644
03:46:11,630 --> 03:46:11,640
it cost more to transmit power than it
 

12645
03:46:11,640 --> 03:46:13,229
it cost more to transmit power than it
cost to generate it which is like you

12646
03:46:13,229 --> 03:46:13,239
cost to generate it which is like you
 

12647
03:46:13,239 --> 03:46:14,429
cost to generate it which is like you
know there's there's all sorts of like

12648
03:46:14,429 --> 03:46:14,439
know there's there's all sorts of like
 

12649
03:46:14,439 --> 03:46:16,110
know there's there's all sorts of like
second order effects that are insane

12650
03:46:16,110 --> 03:46:16,120
second order effects that are insane
 

12651
03:46:16,120 --> 03:46:17,990
second order effects that are insane
here can the power grid support this

12652
03:46:17,990 --> 03:46:18,000
here can the power grid support this
 

12653
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:19,429
here can the power grid support this
kind of growth you know Trump's

12654
03:46:19,429 --> 03:46:19,439
kind of growth you know Trump's
 

12655
03:46:19,439 --> 03:46:20,950
kind of growth you know Trump's
executive orders there was a there was a

12656
03:46:20,950 --> 03:46:20,960
executive orders there was a there was a
 

12657
03:46:20,960 --> 03:46:22,309
executive orders there was a there was a
Biden executive order before the end of

12658
03:46:22,309 --> 03:46:22,319
Biden executive order before the end of
 

12659
03:46:22,319 --> 03:46:23,790
Biden executive order before the end of
the year but then Trump had some more

12660
03:46:23,790 --> 03:46:23,800
the year but then Trump had some more
 

12661
03:46:23,800 --> 03:46:26,469
the year but then Trump had some more
executive orders which uh hopefully

12662
03:46:26,469 --> 03:46:26,479
executive orders which uh hopefully
 

12663
03:46:26,479 --> 03:46:28,590
executive orders which uh hopefully
reduced the regulations to where yes

12664
03:46:28,590 --> 03:46:28,600
reduced the regulations to where yes
 

12665
03:46:28,600 --> 03:46:31,189
reduced the regulations to where yes
things can be built um but yeah this is

12666
03:46:31,189 --> 03:46:31,199
things can be built um but yeah this is
 

12667
03:46:31,199 --> 03:46:32,790
things can be built um but yeah this is
a big big challenge right is building

12668
03:46:32,790 --> 03:46:32,800
a big big challenge right is building
 

12669
03:46:32,800 --> 03:46:34,269
a big big challenge right is building
enough power fast enough are are you

12670
03:46:34,269 --> 03:46:34,279
enough power fast enough are are you
 

12671
03:46:34,279 --> 03:46:35,790
enough power fast enough are are you
going to basically have a nuclear power

12672
03:46:35,790 --> 03:46:35,800
going to basically have a nuclear power
 

12673
03:46:35,800 --> 03:46:37,950
going to basically have a nuclear power
plant next to a data center for each one

12674
03:46:37,950 --> 03:46:37,960
plant next to a data center for each one
 

12675
03:46:37,960 --> 03:46:40,510
plant next to a data center for each one
of these so so the fun thing here is

12676
03:46:40,510 --> 03:46:40,520
of these so so the fun thing here is
 

12677
03:46:40,520 --> 03:46:43,149
of these so so the fun thing here is
this is too slow to build the power

12678
03:46:43,149 --> 03:46:43,159
this is too slow to build the power
 

12679
03:46:43,159 --> 03:46:45,830
this is too slow to build the power
plant to build a power plant or to re

12680
03:46:45,830 --> 03:46:45,840
plant to build a power plant or to re
 

12681
03:46:45,840 --> 03:46:47,469
plant to build a power plant or to re
configure an existing power plant is too

12682
03:46:47,469 --> 03:46:47,479
configure an existing power plant is too
 

12683
03:46:47,479 --> 03:46:50,870
configure an existing power plant is too
slow and so therefore you must use natur

12684
03:46:50,870 --> 03:46:50,880
slow and so therefore you must use natur
 

12685
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:52,349
slow and so therefore you must use natur
data center power consumption is flat

12686
03:46:52,349 --> 03:46:52,359
data center power consumption is flat
 

12687
03:46:52,359 --> 03:46:53,870
data center power consumption is flat
right you know I mean like it's which is

12688
03:46:53,870 --> 03:46:53,880
right you know I mean like it's which is
 

12689
03:46:53,880 --> 03:46:55,550
right you know I mean like it's which is
why nuclear is also good for it like

12690
03:46:55,550 --> 03:46:55,560
why nuclear is also good for it like
 

12691
03:46:55,560 --> 03:46:58,349
why nuclear is also good for it like
longterm nuclear is a very natural fit

12692
03:46:58,349 --> 03:46:58,359
longterm nuclear is a very natural fit
 

12693
03:46:58,359 --> 03:47:00,870
longterm nuclear is a very natural fit
but need a short you can't do solar in

12694
03:47:00,870 --> 03:47:00,880
but need a short you can't do solar in
 

12695
03:47:00,880 --> 03:47:02,790
but need a short you can't do solar in
anything in the short term like that

12696
03:47:02,790 --> 03:47:02,800
anything in the short term like that
 

12697
03:47:02,800 --> 03:47:03,870
anything in the short term like that
because data center power is like this

12698
03:47:03,870 --> 03:47:03,880
because data center power is like this
 

12699
03:47:03,880 --> 03:47:05,550
because data center power is like this
right like you're telling me you know

12700
03:47:05,550 --> 03:47:05,560
right like you're telling me you know
 

12701
03:47:05,560 --> 03:47:07,630
right like you're telling me you know
I'm going to buy tens of billions of

12702
03:47:07,630 --> 03:47:07,640
I'm going to buy tens of billions of
 

12703
03:47:07,640 --> 03:47:09,630
I'm going to buy tens of billions of
dollars of gpus and idle them because

12704
03:47:09,630 --> 03:47:09,640
dollars of gpus and idle them because
 

12705
03:47:09,640 --> 03:47:10,750
dollars of gpus and idle them because
the power is not being generated like

12706
03:47:10,750 --> 03:47:10,760
the power is not being generated like
 

12707
03:47:10,760 --> 03:47:12,189
the power is not being generated like
power is cheap right like if you look at

12708
03:47:12,189 --> 03:47:12,199
power is cheap right like if you look at
 

12709
03:47:12,199 --> 03:47:14,550
power is cheap right like if you look at
the cost of a cluster less than 20% of

12710
03:47:14,550 --> 03:47:14,560
the cost of a cluster less than 20% of
 

12711
03:47:14,560 --> 03:47:17,070
the cost of a cluster less than 20% of
it is power right uh most of it is the

12712
03:47:17,070 --> 03:47:17,080
it is power right uh most of it is the
 

12713
03:47:17,080 --> 03:47:18,590
it is power right uh most of it is the
capital cost and depreciation of the

12714
03:47:18,590 --> 03:47:18,600
capital cost and depreciation of the
 

12715
03:47:18,600 --> 03:47:21,229
capital cost and depreciation of the
gpus right and so it's like well screw

12716
03:47:21,229 --> 03:47:21,239
gpus right and so it's like well screw
 

12717
03:47:21,239 --> 03:47:22,269
gpus right and so it's like well screw
it I'll just like you know I'll just

12718
03:47:22,269 --> 03:47:22,279
it I'll just like you know I'll just
 

12719
03:47:22,279 --> 03:47:23,389
it I'll just like you know I'll just
build natural gas plant this is what

12720
03:47:23,389 --> 03:47:23,399
build natural gas plant this is what
 

12721
03:47:23,399 --> 03:47:24,790
build natural gas plant this is what
meta is doing in Louisiana this is what

12722
03:47:24,790 --> 03:47:24,800
meta is doing in Louisiana this is what
 

12723
03:47:24,800 --> 03:47:27,309
meta is doing in Louisiana this is what
open AI is doing in in Texas and like

12724
03:47:27,309 --> 03:47:27,319
open AI is doing in in Texas and like
 

12725
03:47:27,319 --> 03:47:28,790
open AI is doing in in Texas and like
all these different places they may not

12726
03:47:28,790 --> 03:47:28,800
all these different places they may not
 

12727
03:47:28,800 --> 03:47:30,710
all these different places they may not
be doing it directly uh but they are

12728
03:47:30,710 --> 03:47:30,720
be doing it directly uh but they are
 

12729
03:47:30,720 --> 03:47:33,030
be doing it directly uh but they are
partnered with someone and so there is a

12730
03:47:33,030 --> 03:47:33,040
partnered with someone and so there is a
 

12731
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:35,469
partnered with someone and so there is a
couple hopes right like one is you know

12732
03:47:35,469 --> 03:47:35,479
couple hopes right like one is you know
 

12733
03:47:35,479 --> 03:47:37,110
couple hopes right like one is you know
and Elon what he's doing in Memphis is

12734
03:47:37,110 --> 03:47:37,120
and Elon what he's doing in Memphis is
 

12735
03:47:37,120 --> 03:47:38,429
and Elon what he's doing in Memphis is
like you know to the extreme they're not

12736
03:47:38,429 --> 03:47:38,439
like you know to the extreme they're not
 

12737
03:47:38,439 --> 03:47:40,630
like you know to the extreme they're not
just using dual combine cycle gas which

12738
03:47:40,630 --> 03:47:40,640
just using dual combine cycle gas which
 

12739
03:47:40,640 --> 03:47:42,429
just using dual combine cycle gas which
is like super efficient he's also just

12740
03:47:42,429 --> 03:47:42,439
is like super efficient he's also just
 

12741
03:47:42,439 --> 03:47:43,990
is like super efficient he's also just
using single cycle and like mobile

12742
03:47:43,990 --> 03:47:44,000
using single cycle and like mobile
 

12743
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:45,269
using single cycle and like mobile
generators and stuff Which is less

12744
03:47:45,269 --> 03:47:45,279
generators and stuff Which is less
 

12745
03:47:45,279 --> 03:47:48,149
generators and stuff Which is less
efficient um but he's you know there's

12746
03:47:48,149 --> 03:47:48,159
efficient um but he's you know there's
 

12747
03:47:48,159 --> 03:47:49,870
efficient um but he's you know there's
also like the flip side which is like

12748
03:47:49,870 --> 03:47:49,880
also like the flip side which is like
 

12749
03:47:49,880 --> 03:47:51,670
also like the flip side which is like
solar power generation is like this and

12750
03:47:51,670 --> 03:47:51,680
solar power generation is like this and
 

12751
03:47:51,680 --> 03:47:53,670
solar power generation is like this and
wind is another like like this different

12752
03:47:53,670 --> 03:47:53,680
wind is another like like this different
 

12753
03:47:53,680 --> 03:47:55,189
wind is another like like this different
correl you know different so if you

12754
03:47:55,189 --> 03:47:55,199
correl you know different so if you
 

12755
03:47:55,199 --> 03:47:57,189
correl you know different so if you
stack both of those plus you get a big

12756
03:47:57,189 --> 03:47:57,199
stack both of those plus you get a big
 

12757
03:47:57,199 --> 03:47:59,349
stack both of those plus you get a big
chunk of batteries um plus you have a

12758
03:47:59,349 --> 03:47:59,359
chunk of batteries um plus you have a
 

12759
03:47:59,359 --> 03:48:01,309
chunk of batteries um plus you have a
little bit of gas it is possible to run

12760
03:48:01,309 --> 03:48:01,319
little bit of gas it is possible to run
 

12761
03:48:01,319 --> 03:48:03,389
little bit of gas it is possible to run
it more green it's just the time scales

12762
03:48:03,389 --> 03:48:03,399
it more green it's just the time scales
 

12763
03:48:03,399 --> 03:48:05,710
it more green it's just the time scales
for that is slow right so people are

12764
03:48:05,710 --> 03:48:05,720
for that is slow right so people are
 

12765
03:48:05,720 --> 03:48:09,269
for that is slow right so people are
trying but you know meta basically said

12766
03:48:09,269 --> 03:48:09,279
trying but you know meta basically said
 

12767
03:48:09,279 --> 03:48:10,349
trying but you know meta basically said
whatever don't care about my

12768
03:48:10,349 --> 03:48:10,359
whatever don't care about my
 

12769
03:48:10,359 --> 03:48:12,469
whatever don't care about my
sustainability pledge or they'll buy

12770
03:48:12,469 --> 03:48:12,479
sustainability pledge or they'll buy
 

12771
03:48:12,479 --> 03:48:14,110
sustainability pledge or they'll buy
like a per power it's called a PPA power

12772
03:48:14,110 --> 03:48:14,120
like a per power it's called a PPA power
 

12773
03:48:14,120 --> 03:48:15,670
like a per power it's called a PPA power
purchasing agreement where there'll be a

12774
03:48:15,670 --> 03:48:15,680
purchasing agreement where there'll be a
 

12775
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:17,429
purchasing agreement where there'll be a
massive Wind Farm or solar farm like

12776
03:48:17,429 --> 03:48:17,439
massive Wind Farm or solar farm like
 

12777
03:48:17,439 --> 03:48:19,110
massive Wind Farm or solar farm like
wherever and then they'll just pretend

12778
03:48:19,110 --> 03:48:19,120
wherever and then they'll just pretend
 

12779
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:20,510
wherever and then they'll just pretend
like those electrons are being consumed

12780
03:48:20,510 --> 03:48:20,520
like those electrons are being consumed
 

12781
03:48:20,520 --> 03:48:22,110
like those electrons are being consumed
by the data center but in reality

12782
03:48:22,110 --> 03:48:22,120
by the data center but in reality
 

12783
03:48:22,120 --> 03:48:23,269
by the data center but in reality
they're paying for the power here and

12784
03:48:23,269 --> 03:48:23,279
they're paying for the power here and
 

12785
03:48:23,279 --> 03:48:24,269
they're paying for the power here and
selling it to the grid and they're

12786
03:48:24,269 --> 03:48:24,279
selling it to the grid and they're
 

12787
03:48:24,279 --> 03:48:26,590
selling it to the grid and they're
buying power here um and then another

12788
03:48:26,590 --> 03:48:26,600
buying power here um and then another
 

12789
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:28,550
buying power here um and then another
thing is like Microsoft quit on some of

12790
03:48:28,550 --> 03:48:28,560
thing is like Microsoft quit on some of
 

12791
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:31,229
thing is like Microsoft quit on some of
their sustainability pledges right Elon

12792
03:48:31,229 --> 03:48:31,239
their sustainability pledges right Elon
 

12793
03:48:31,239 --> 03:48:32,710
their sustainability pledges right Elon
uh he what he did with Memphis is

12794
03:48:32,710 --> 03:48:32,720
uh he what he did with Memphis is
 

12795
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:34,550
uh he what he did with Memphis is
objectively somewhat dirty but he's also

12796
03:48:34,550 --> 03:48:34,560
objectively somewhat dirty but he's also
 

12797
03:48:34,560 --> 03:48:36,429
objectively somewhat dirty but he's also
doing it in an area where there's like a

12798
03:48:36,429 --> 03:48:36,439
doing it in an area where there's like a
 

12799
03:48:36,439 --> 03:48:38,469
doing it in an area where there's like a
bigger natural gas plant right next door

12800
03:48:38,469 --> 03:48:38,479
bigger natural gas plant right next door
 

12801
03:48:38,479 --> 03:48:40,389
bigger natural gas plant right next door
and like a sewer next or not a sewer but

12802
03:48:40,389 --> 03:48:40,399
and like a sewer next or not a sewer but
 

12803
03:48:40,399 --> 03:48:41,510
and like a sewer next or not a sewer but
like a wastewater treatment and a

12804
03:48:41,510 --> 03:48:41,520
like a wastewater treatment and a
 

12805
03:48:41,520 --> 03:48:43,429
like a wastewater treatment and a
garbage dump nearby right and and and

12806
03:48:43,429 --> 03:48:43,439
garbage dump nearby right and and and
 

12807
03:48:43,439 --> 03:48:45,229
garbage dump nearby right and and and
he's he's obviously made the world a lot

12808
03:48:45,229 --> 03:48:45,239
he's he's obviously made the world a lot
 

12809
03:48:45,239 --> 03:48:46,950
he's he's obviously made the world a lot
more clean than that one data center is

12810
03:48:46,950 --> 03:48:46,960
more clean than that one data center is
 

12811
03:48:46,960 --> 03:48:48,670
more clean than that one data center is
going to do right so I think like it's

12812
03:48:48,670 --> 03:48:48,680
going to do right so I think like it's
 

12813
03:48:48,680 --> 03:48:51,269
going to do right so I think like it's
fine uh to some extent and maybe AGI

12814
03:48:51,269 --> 03:48:51,279
fine uh to some extent and maybe AGI
 

12815
03:48:51,279 --> 03:48:52,950
fine uh to some extent and maybe AGI
solves you know global warming and stuff

12816
03:48:52,950 --> 03:48:52,960
solves you know global warming and stuff
 

12817
03:48:52,960 --> 03:48:55,349
solves you know global warming and stuff
right whatever it is um you know this is

12818
03:48:55,349 --> 03:48:55,359
right whatever it is um you know this is
 

12819
03:48:55,359 --> 03:48:56,670
right whatever it is um you know this is
this is sort of the attitude that people

12820
03:48:56,670 --> 03:48:56,680
this is sort of the attitude that people
 

12821
03:48:56,680 --> 03:48:58,309
this is sort of the attitude that people
at the labs have right which is like

12822
03:48:58,309 --> 03:48:58,319
at the labs have right which is like
 

12823
03:48:58,319 --> 03:49:00,030
at the labs have right which is like
yeah SC we'll just use gas right because

12824
03:49:00,030 --> 03:49:00,040
yeah SC we'll just use gas right because
 

12825
03:49:00,040 --> 03:49:01,630
yeah SC we'll just use gas right because
the race is that important and if we

12826
03:49:01,630 --> 03:49:01,640
the race is that important and if we
 

12827
03:49:01,640 --> 03:49:03,950
the race is that important and if we
lose we you know that's way worse right

12828
03:49:03,950 --> 03:49:03,960
lose we you know that's way worse right
 

12829
03:49:03,960 --> 03:49:05,670
lose we you know that's way worse right
I should say that uh I got a chance to

12830
03:49:05,670 --> 03:49:05,680
I should say that uh I got a chance to
 

12831
03:49:05,680 --> 03:49:08,469
I should say that uh I got a chance to
visit um the Memphis data center oh wow

12832
03:49:08,469 --> 03:49:08,479
visit um the Memphis data center oh wow
 

12833
03:49:08,479 --> 03:49:11,550
visit um the Memphis data center oh wow
and it's uh kind of incredible I mean I

12834
03:49:11,550 --> 03:49:11,560
and it's uh kind of incredible I mean I
 

12835
03:49:11,560 --> 03:49:13,070
and it's uh kind of incredible I mean I
visited with with

12836
03:49:13,070 --> 03:49:13,080
visited with with
 

12837
03:49:13,080 --> 03:49:16,590
visited with with
Elon just the team themes and the rate

12838
03:49:16,590 --> 03:49:16,600
Elon just the team themes and the rate
 

12839
03:49:16,600 --> 03:49:19,269
Elon just the team themes and the rate
of innovation there is insane cuz my

12840
03:49:19,269 --> 03:49:19,279
of innovation there is insane cuz my
 

12841
03:49:19,279 --> 03:49:21,349
of innovation there is insane cuz my
sense is that you know nobody's ever

12842
03:49:21,349 --> 03:49:21,359
sense is that you know nobody's ever
 

12843
03:49:21,359 --> 03:49:23,830
sense is that you know nobody's ever
done anything of this scale and nobody

12844
03:49:23,830 --> 03:49:23,840
done anything of this scale and nobody
 

12845
03:49:23,840 --> 03:49:26,309
done anything of this scale and nobody
has certainly ever done anything of this

12846
03:49:26,309 --> 03:49:26,319
has certainly ever done anything of this
 

12847
03:49:26,319 --> 03:49:29,229
has certainly ever done anything of this
scale at the rate that XI is doing so

12848
03:49:29,229 --> 03:49:29,239
scale at the rate that XI is doing so
 

12849
03:49:29,239 --> 03:49:32,269
scale at the rate that XI is doing so
they're like figuring out I mean it's I

12850
03:49:32,269 --> 03:49:32,279
they're like figuring out I mean it's I
 

12851
03:49:32,279 --> 03:49:33,830
they're like figuring out I mean it's I
sitting in on all these meetings with

12852
03:49:33,830 --> 03:49:33,840
sitting in on all these meetings with
 

12853
03:49:33,840 --> 03:49:35,830
sitting in on all these meetings with
their brainstorming it's like it's

12854
03:49:35,830 --> 03:49:35,840
their brainstorming it's like it's
 

12855
03:49:35,840 --> 03:49:38,110
their brainstorming it's like it's
insane it's exciting because they're

12856
03:49:38,110 --> 03:49:38,120
insane it's exciting because they're
 

12857
03:49:38,120 --> 03:49:39,510
insane it's exciting because they're
like they're trying to figure out what

12858
03:49:39,510 --> 03:49:39,520
like they're trying to figure out what
 

12859
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:41,189
like they're trying to figure out what
the bottlenecks are how to remove the

12860
03:49:41,189 --> 03:49:41,199
the bottlenecks are how to remove the
 

12861
03:49:41,199 --> 03:49:43,070
the bottlenecks are how to remove the
bottlenecks how to make sure that you

12862
03:49:43,070 --> 03:49:43,080
bottlenecks how to make sure that you
 

12863
03:49:43,080 --> 03:49:45,309
bottlenecks how to make sure that you
know there's just so many really cool

12864
03:49:45,309 --> 03:49:45,319
know there's just so many really cool
 

12865
03:49:45,319 --> 03:49:47,269
know there's just so many really cool
things about putting together a data

12866
03:49:47,269 --> 03:49:47,279
things about putting together a data
 

12867
03:49:47,279 --> 03:49:50,870
things about putting together a data
center cuz you know everything has to

12868
03:49:50,870 --> 03:49:50,880
center cuz you know everything has to
 

12869
03:49:50,880 --> 03:49:54,030
center cuz you know everything has to
work it's uh the the people that do like

12870
03:49:54,030 --> 03:49:54,040
work it's uh the the people that do like
 

12871
03:49:54,040 --> 03:49:55,750
work it's uh the the people that do like
the CIS admin you know the machine

12872
03:49:55,750 --> 03:49:55,760
the CIS admin you know the machine
 

12873
03:49:55,760 --> 03:49:57,630
the CIS admin you know the machine
learning all that is the exciting thing

12874
03:49:57,630 --> 03:49:57,640
learning all that is the exciting thing
 

12875
03:49:57,640 --> 03:49:59,309
learning all that is the exciting thing
so on but really the people that run

12876
03:49:59,309 --> 03:49:59,319
so on but really the people that run
 

12877
03:49:59,319 --> 03:50:01,910
so on but really the people that run
everything are the the folks that know

12878
03:50:01,910 --> 03:50:01,920
everything are the the folks that know
 

12879
03:50:01,920 --> 03:50:02,910
everything are the the folks that know
like the

12880
03:50:02,910 --> 03:50:02,920
like the
 

12881
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:05,469
like the
lowlevel uh software and Hardware that

12882
03:50:05,469 --> 03:50:05,479
lowlevel uh software and Hardware that
 

12883
03:50:05,479 --> 03:50:07,710
lowlevel uh software and Hardware that
runs everything the networking all of

12884
03:50:07,710 --> 03:50:07,720
runs everything the networking all of
 

12885
03:50:07,720 --> 03:50:10,229
runs everything the networking all of
that and so you have to like make sure

12886
03:50:10,229 --> 03:50:10,239
that and so you have to like make sure
 

12887
03:50:10,239 --> 03:50:12,110
that and so you have to like make sure
you have procedures that test everything

12888
03:50:12,110 --> 03:50:12,120
you have procedures that test everything
 

12889
03:50:12,120 --> 03:50:13,910
you have procedures that test everything
I think they're using ethernet I don't

12890
03:50:13,910 --> 03:50:13,920
I think they're using ethernet I don't
 

12891
03:50:13,920 --> 03:50:15,269
I think they're using ethernet I don't
know how they're doing that working but

12892
03:50:15,269 --> 03:50:15,279
know how they're doing that working but
 

12893
03:50:15,279 --> 03:50:17,550
know how they're doing that working but
they're using Nvidia Spectrum X ethernet

12894
03:50:17,550 --> 03:50:17,560
they're using Nvidia Spectrum X ethernet
 

12895
03:50:17,560 --> 03:50:19,510
they're using Nvidia Spectrum X ethernet
um there's actually like I think yeah

12896
03:50:19,510 --> 03:50:19,520
um there's actually like I think yeah
 

12897
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:21,189
um there's actually like I think yeah
the unsung heroes are the cooling and

12898
03:50:21,189 --> 03:50:21,199
the unsung heroes are the cooling and
 

12899
03:50:21,199 --> 03:50:23,110
the unsung heroes are the cooling and
electrical systems which are just

12900
03:50:23,110 --> 03:50:23,120
electrical systems which are just
 

12901
03:50:23,120 --> 03:50:26,429
electrical systems which are just
glossed over um but I think like like

12902
03:50:26,429 --> 03:50:26,439
glossed over um but I think like like
 

12903
03:50:26,439 --> 03:50:28,630
glossed over um but I think like like
one story that maybe is like exemplifies

12904
03:50:28,630 --> 03:50:28,640
one story that maybe is like exemplifies
 

12905
03:50:28,640 --> 03:50:31,149
one story that maybe is like exemplifies
how insane this stuff is is uh when

12906
03:50:31,149 --> 03:50:31,159
how insane this stuff is is uh when
 

12907
03:50:31,159 --> 03:50:33,510
how insane this stuff is is uh when
you're training right um you're always

12908
03:50:33,510 --> 03:50:33,520
you're training right um you're always
 

12909
03:50:33,520 --> 03:50:34,990
you're training right um you're always
doing you're you're you're running

12910
03:50:34,990 --> 03:50:35,000
doing you're you're you're running
 

12911
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:36,070
doing you're you're you're running
through the model a bunch right in the

12912
03:50:36,070 --> 03:50:36,080
through the model a bunch right in the
 

12913
03:50:36,080 --> 03:50:37,309
through the model a bunch right in the
most simplistic terms running through

12914
03:50:37,309 --> 03:50:37,319
most simplistic terms running through
 

12915
03:50:37,319 --> 03:50:39,990
most simplistic terms running through
the model a bunch and then you're uh

12916
03:50:39,990 --> 03:50:40,000
the model a bunch and then you're uh
 

12917
03:50:40,000 --> 03:50:41,750
the model a bunch and then you're uh
you're going to exchange everything and

12918
03:50:41,750 --> 03:50:41,760
you're going to exchange everything and
 

12919
03:50:41,760 --> 03:50:43,469
you're going to exchange everything and
synchronize the weights right so you do

12920
03:50:43,469 --> 03:50:43,479
synchronize the weights right so you do
 

12921
03:50:43,479 --> 03:50:44,950
synchronize the weights right so you do
you'll do a step this is like a step in

12922
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:44,960
you'll do a step this is like a step in
 

12923
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:46,389
you'll do a step this is like a step in
model training right and every step your

12924
03:50:46,389 --> 03:50:46,399
model training right and every step your
 

12925
03:50:46,399 --> 03:50:47,830
model training right and every step your
loss goes down hopefully and it doesn't

12926
03:50:47,830 --> 03:50:47,840
loss goes down hopefully and it doesn't
 

12927
03:50:47,840 --> 03:50:50,110
loss goes down hopefully and it doesn't
always but um you in the simplest terms

12928
03:50:50,110 --> 03:50:50,120
always but um you in the simplest terms
 

12929
03:50:50,120 --> 03:50:51,189
always but um you in the simplest terms
you'll be Computing a lot and then

12930
03:50:51,189 --> 03:50:51,199
you'll be Computing a lot and then
 

12931
03:50:51,199 --> 03:50:53,030
you'll be Computing a lot and then
you'll exchange right the interesting

12932
03:50:53,030 --> 03:50:53,040
you'll exchange right the interesting
 

12933
03:50:53,040 --> 03:50:54,469
you'll exchange right the interesting
thing is GPU power is most of it

12934
03:50:54,469 --> 03:50:54,479
thing is GPU power is most of it
 

12935
03:50:54,479 --> 03:50:55,870
thing is GPU power is most of it
networking power is some but it's a lot

12936
03:50:55,870 --> 03:50:55,880
networking power is some but it's a lot
 

12937
03:50:55,880 --> 03:50:57,910
networking power is some but it's a lot
less but so while you're Computing your

12938
03:50:57,910 --> 03:50:57,920
less but so while you're Computing your
 

12939
03:50:57,920 --> 03:50:59,510
less but so while you're Computing your
power for your gpus is here but then

12940
03:50:59,510 --> 03:50:59,520
power for your gpus is here but then
 

12941
03:50:59,520 --> 03:51:01,309
power for your gpus is here but then
when you're exchanging weights uh if

12942
03:51:01,309 --> 03:51:01,319
when you're exchanging weights uh if
 

12943
03:51:01,319 --> 03:51:02,469
when you're exchanging weights uh if
you're not able to overlap

12944
03:51:02,469 --> 03:51:02,479
you're not able to overlap
 

12945
03:51:02,479 --> 03:51:04,229
you're not able to overlap
Communications and compute perfectly

12946
03:51:04,229 --> 03:51:04,239
Communications and compute perfectly
 

12947
03:51:04,239 --> 03:51:05,429
Communications and compute perfectly
there may be a time period where your

12948
03:51:05,429 --> 03:51:05,439
there may be a time period where your
 

12949
03:51:05,439 --> 03:51:07,670
there may be a time period where your
gpus are just idle and you're exchanging

12950
03:51:07,670 --> 03:51:07,680
gpus are just idle and you're exchanging
 

12951
03:51:07,680 --> 03:51:08,990
gpus are just idle and you're exchanging
weights and you're like hey the model's

12952
03:51:08,990 --> 03:51:09,000
weights and you're like hey the model's
 

12953
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:10,189
weights and you're like hey the model's
updating so you're exchanging the

12954
03:51:10,189 --> 03:51:10,199
updating so you're exchanging the
 

12955
03:51:10,199 --> 03:51:11,990
updating so you're exchanging the
gradients you do the model update and

12956
03:51:11,990 --> 03:51:12,000
gradients you do the model update and
 

12957
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:13,710
gradients you do the model update and
then you you start training again so the

12958
03:51:13,710 --> 03:51:13,720
then you you start training again so the
 

12959
03:51:13,720 --> 03:51:16,229
then you you start training again so the
power goes mhm right and it's super

12960
03:51:16,229 --> 03:51:16,239
power goes mhm right and it's super
 

12961
03:51:16,239 --> 03:51:18,750
power goes mhm right and it's super
spiky and so funnily enough right like

12962
03:51:18,750 --> 03:51:18,760
spiky and so funnily enough right like
 

12963
03:51:18,760 --> 03:51:20,790
spiky and so funnily enough right like
this when you talk about the scale of

12964
03:51:20,790 --> 03:51:20,800
this when you talk about the scale of
 

12965
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:22,429
this when you talk about the scale of
data center power right you can blow

12966
03:51:22,429 --> 03:51:22,439
data center power right you can blow
 

12967
03:51:22,439 --> 03:51:25,510
data center power right you can blow
stuff up so easily um and So Meta

12968
03:51:25,510 --> 03:51:25,520
stuff up so easily um and So Meta
 

12969
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:28,110
stuff up so easily um and So Meta
actually has accidentally open

12970
03:51:28,110 --> 03:51:28,120
actually has accidentally open
 

12971
03:51:28,120 --> 03:51:30,269
actually has accidentally open
upstreamed something to code and pytorch

12972
03:51:30,269 --> 03:51:30,279
upstreamed something to code and pytorch
 

12973
03:51:30,279 --> 03:51:32,229
upstreamed something to code and pytorch
where they added an operator and I kid

12974
03:51:32,229 --> 03:51:32,239
where they added an operator and I kid
 

12975
03:51:32,239 --> 03:51:33,630
where they added an operator and I kid
you not whoever made this like I want to

12976
03:51:33,630 --> 03:51:33,640
you not whoever made this like I want to
 

12977
03:51:33,640 --> 03:51:36,510
you not whoever made this like I want to
hug the guy because it says says pytorch

12978
03:51:36,510 --> 03:51:36,520
hug the guy because it says says pytorch
 

12979
03:51:36,520 --> 03:51:38,149
hug the guy because it says says pytorch
uh it's like py torch. PowerPlant no

12980
03:51:38,149 --> 03:51:38,159
uh it's like py torch. PowerPlant no
 

12981
03:51:38,159 --> 03:51:41,670
uh it's like py torch. PowerPlant no
blowup equal zero or equal one and and

12982
03:51:41,670 --> 03:51:41,680
blowup equal zero or equal one and and
 

12983
03:51:41,680 --> 03:51:43,710
blowup equal zero or equal one and and
what it does what it does is amazing

12984
03:51:43,710 --> 03:51:43,720
what it does what it does is amazing
 

12985
03:51:43,720 --> 03:51:45,269
what it does what it does is amazing
right either you know when you're when

12986
03:51:45,269 --> 03:51:45,279
right either you know when you're when
 

12987
03:51:45,279 --> 03:51:46,910
right either you know when you're when
you're exchanging the weights the GPU

12988
03:51:46,910 --> 03:51:46,920
you're exchanging the weights the GPU
 

12989
03:51:46,920 --> 03:51:48,510
you're exchanging the weights the GPU
will just compute fake numbers so the

12990
03:51:48,510 --> 03:51:48,520
will just compute fake numbers so the
 

12991
03:51:48,520 --> 03:51:50,229
will just compute fake numbers so the
power doesn't Spike too much and so then

12992
03:51:50,229 --> 03:51:50,239
power doesn't Spike too much and so then
 

12993
03:51:50,239 --> 03:51:51,550
power doesn't Spike too much and so then
the power plants don't blow up because

12994
03:51:51,550 --> 03:51:51,560
the power plants don't blow up because
 

12995
03:51:51,560 --> 03:51:54,189
the power plants don't blow up because
the transient spikes like screw stuff up

12996
03:51:54,189 --> 03:51:54,199
the transient spikes like screw stuff up
 

12997
03:51:54,199 --> 03:51:55,510
the transient spikes like screw stuff up
well that makes sense I mean you have to

12998
03:51:55,510 --> 03:51:55,520
well that makes sense I mean you have to
 

12999
03:51:55,520 --> 03:51:57,830
well that makes sense I mean you have to
do that kind of thing you have to make

13000
03:51:57,830 --> 03:51:57,840
do that kind of thing you have to make
 

13001
03:51:57,840 --> 03:51:59,750
do that kind of thing you have to make
sure they're not idle yeah an Elon

13002
03:51:59,750 --> 03:51:59,760
sure they're not idle yeah an Elon
 

13003
03:51:59,760 --> 03:52:00,870
sure they're not idle yeah an Elon
solution was like let me throw a bunch

13004
03:52:00,870 --> 03:52:00,880
solution was like let me throw a bunch
 

13005
03:52:00,880 --> 03:52:02,229
solution was like let me throw a bunch
of Tesla Mega packs and a few other

13006
03:52:02,229 --> 03:52:02,239
of Tesla Mega packs and a few other
 

13007
03:52:02,239 --> 03:52:03,750
of Tesla Mega packs and a few other
things right like there everyone has

13008
03:52:03,750 --> 03:52:03,760
things right like there everyone has
 

13009
03:52:03,760 --> 03:52:05,590
things right like there everyone has
different solutions but like metas at

13010
03:52:05,590 --> 03:52:05,600
different solutions but like metas at
 

13011
03:52:05,600 --> 03:52:07,229
different solutions but like metas at
least was publicly and openly known

13012
03:52:07,229 --> 03:52:07,239
least was publicly and openly known
 

13013
03:52:07,239 --> 03:52:09,309
least was publicly and openly known
which is just like set this operator and

13014
03:52:09,309 --> 03:52:09,319
which is just like set this operator and
 

13015
03:52:09,319 --> 03:52:10,950
which is just like set this operator and
what this operator does is it just makes

13016
03:52:10,950 --> 03:52:10,960
what this operator does is it just makes
 

13017
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:13,269
what this operator does is it just makes
the gpus compute nothing so that the

13018
03:52:13,269 --> 03:52:13,279
the gpus compute nothing so that the
 

13019
03:52:13,279 --> 03:52:15,149
the gpus compute nothing so that the
power doesn't Spike but that just tells

13020
03:52:15,149 --> 03:52:15,159
power doesn't Spike but that just tells
 

13021
03:52:15,159 --> 03:52:17,070
power doesn't Spike but that just tells
you how much power you're working with I

13022
03:52:17,070 --> 03:52:17,080
you how much power you're working with I
 

13023
03:52:17,080 --> 03:52:19,030
you how much power you're working with I
mean it's insane it's insane people

13024
03:52:19,030 --> 03:52:19,040
mean it's insane it's insane people
 

13025
03:52:19,040 --> 03:52:21,710
mean it's insane it's insane people
should just go Google like scale like

13026
03:52:21,710 --> 03:52:21,720
should just go Google like scale like
 

13027
03:52:21,720 --> 03:52:24,189
should just go Google like scale like
what does X watts do and go through all

13028
03:52:24,189 --> 03:52:24,199
what does X watts do and go through all
 

13029
03:52:24,199 --> 03:52:26,189
what does X watts do and go through all
the scales from one watt to a kilowatt

13030
03:52:26,189 --> 03:52:26,199
the scales from one watt to a kilowatt
 

13031
03:52:26,199 --> 03:52:28,469
the scales from one watt to a kilowatt
to a megawatt and you look at stare at

13032
03:52:28,469 --> 03:52:28,479
to a megawatt and you look at stare at
 

13033
03:52:28,479 --> 03:52:30,469
to a megawatt and you look at stare at
that and you're how high in the list a

13034
03:52:30,469 --> 03:52:30,479
that and you're how high in the list a
 

13035
03:52:30,479 --> 03:52:33,030
that and you're how high in the list a
gigawatt is and it's

13036
03:52:33,030 --> 03:52:33,040
gigawatt is and it's
 

13037
03:52:33,040 --> 03:52:34,830
gigawatt is and it's
mind-blowing can you say something about

13038
03:52:34,830 --> 03:52:34,840
mind-blowing can you say something about
 

13039
03:52:34,840 --> 03:52:37,510
mind-blowing can you say something about
the cooling so I I know elon's using

13040
03:52:37,510 --> 03:52:37,520
the cooling so I I know elon's using
 

13041
03:52:37,520 --> 03:52:42,149
the cooling so I I know elon's using
liquid cooling I believe in in all cases

13042
03:52:42,149 --> 03:52:42,159
liquid cooling I believe in in all cases
 

13043
03:52:42,159 --> 03:52:43,910
liquid cooling I believe in in all cases
uh that's a new thing right most of them

13044
03:52:43,910 --> 03:52:43,920
uh that's a new thing right most of them
 

13045
03:52:43,920 --> 03:52:45,590
uh that's a new thing right most of them
don't use cooling is there something

13046
03:52:45,590 --> 03:52:45,600
don't use cooling is there something
 

13047
03:52:45,600 --> 03:52:46,950
don't use cooling is there something
interesting to say about the cooling

13048
03:52:46,950 --> 03:52:46,960
interesting to say about the cooling
 

13049
03:52:46,960 --> 03:52:48,429
interesting to say about the cooling
yeah yeah so air cooling has been the

13050
03:52:48,429 --> 03:52:48,439
yeah yeah so air cooling has been the
 

13051
03:52:48,439 --> 03:52:50,950
yeah yeah so air cooling has been the
deao standard uh throw a bunch of metal

13052
03:52:50,950 --> 03:52:50,960
deao standard uh throw a bunch of metal
 

13053
03:52:50,960 --> 03:52:53,149
deao standard uh throw a bunch of metal
heat heat pipes Etc and and fans right

13054
03:52:53,149 --> 03:52:53,159
heat heat pipes Etc and and fans right
 

13055
03:52:53,159 --> 03:52:54,469
heat heat pipes Etc and and fans right
and like that's cooled that's been

13056
03:52:54,469 --> 03:52:54,479
and like that's cooled that's been
 

13057
03:52:54,479 --> 03:52:56,790
and like that's cooled that's been
enough to cool it um people have been

13058
03:52:56,790 --> 03:52:56,800
enough to cool it um people have been
 

13059
03:52:56,800 --> 03:52:59,590
enough to cool it um people have been
dabbling in water cooling Google's tpus

13060
03:52:59,590 --> 03:52:59,600
dabbling in water cooling Google's tpus
 

13061
03:52:59,600 --> 03:53:01,670
dabbling in water cooling Google's tpus
are water cooled right um so they've

13062
03:53:01,670 --> 03:53:01,680
are water cooled right um so they've
 

13063
03:53:01,680 --> 03:53:04,149
are water cooled right um so they've
been doing that for a few years uh but

13064
03:53:04,149 --> 03:53:04,159
been doing that for a few years uh but
 

13065
03:53:04,159 --> 03:53:06,030
been doing that for a few years uh but
uh with gpus no one's ever done and and

13066
03:53:06,030 --> 03:53:06,040
uh with gpus no one's ever done and and
 

13067
03:53:06,040 --> 03:53:07,149
uh with gpus no one's ever done and and
no one's ever done the scale of water

13068
03:53:07,149 --> 03:53:07,159
no one's ever done the scale of water
 

13069
03:53:07,159 --> 03:53:09,670
no one's ever done the scale of water
cooling that Elon just did right uh um

13070
03:53:09,670 --> 03:53:09,680
cooling that Elon just did right uh um
 

13071
03:53:09,680 --> 03:53:12,309
cooling that Elon just did right uh um
now next Generation Nvidia is uh for the

13072
03:53:12,309 --> 03:53:12,319
now next Generation Nvidia is uh for the
 

13073
03:53:12,319 --> 03:53:14,070
now next Generation Nvidia is uh for the
for the like highest end GPU it is

13074
03:53:14,070 --> 03:53:14,080
for the like highest end GPU it is
 

13075
03:53:14,080 --> 03:53:15,590
for the like highest end GPU it is
mandat water cooling you have to water

13076
03:53:15,590 --> 03:53:15,600
mandat water cooling you have to water
 

13077
03:53:15,600 --> 03:53:17,910
mandat water cooling you have to water
cool it but Elon did it on this current

13078
03:53:17,910 --> 03:53:17,920
cool it but Elon did it on this current
 

13079
03:53:17,920 --> 03:53:19,870
cool it but Elon did it on this current
generation uh and that required a lot of

13080
03:53:19,870 --> 03:53:19,880
generation uh and that required a lot of
 

13081
03:53:19,880 --> 03:53:20,990
generation uh and that required a lot of
stuff right if you look at like some of

13082
03:53:20,990 --> 03:53:21,000
stuff right if you look at like some of
 

13083
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:23,990
stuff right if you look at like some of
the satellite photos and stuff of of uh

13084
03:53:23,990 --> 03:53:24,000
the satellite photos and stuff of of uh
 

13085
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:25,870
the satellite photos and stuff of of uh
the Memphis facility there's all these

13086
03:53:25,870 --> 03:53:25,880
the Memphis facility there's all these
 

13087
03:53:25,880 --> 03:53:27,590
the Memphis facility there's all these
external water chillers that are sitting

13088
03:53:27,590 --> 03:53:27,600
external water chillers that are sitting
 

13089
03:53:27,600 --> 03:53:28,870
external water chillers that are sitting
basically it looks like a it looks like

13090
03:53:28,870 --> 03:53:28,880
basically it looks like a it looks like
 

13091
03:53:28,880 --> 03:53:31,269
basically it looks like a it looks like
a semi- pod thing what's it called the

13092
03:53:31,269 --> 03:53:31,279
a semi- pod thing what's it called the
 

13093
03:53:31,279 --> 03:53:32,870
a semi- pod thing what's it called the
container uh but really those are water

13094
03:53:32,870 --> 03:53:32,880
container uh but really those are water
 

13095
03:53:32,880 --> 03:53:34,510
container uh but really those are water
chillers and he has like 90 of those

13096
03:53:34,510 --> 03:53:34,520
chillers and he has like 90 of those
 

13097
03:53:34,520 --> 03:53:36,349
chillers and he has like 90 of those
water chillers just sitting outside 90

13098
03:53:36,349 --> 03:53:36,359
water chillers just sitting outside 90
 

13099
03:53:36,359 --> 03:53:37,910
water chillers just sitting outside 90
different containers right with water

13100
03:53:37,910 --> 03:53:37,920
different containers right with water
 

13101
03:53:37,920 --> 03:53:39,790
different containers right with water
you know that chill the water bring it

13102
03:53:39,790 --> 03:53:39,800
you know that chill the water bring it
 

13103
03:53:39,800 --> 03:53:41,189
you know that chill the water bring it
back to the data center and then you

13104
03:53:41,189 --> 03:53:41,199
back to the data center and then you
 

13105
03:53:41,199 --> 03:53:43,189
back to the data center and then you
distribute it to all the chips pull all

13106
03:53:43,189 --> 03:53:43,199
distribute it to all the chips pull all
 

13107
03:53:43,199 --> 03:53:44,710
distribute it to all the chips pull all
the heat out and then send it back right

13108
03:53:44,710 --> 03:53:44,720
the heat out and then send it back right
 

13109
03:53:44,720 --> 03:53:47,429
the heat out and then send it back right
and this is both a uh way to cool the

13110
03:53:47,429 --> 03:53:47,439
and this is both a uh way to cool the
 

13111
03:53:47,439 --> 03:53:49,630
and this is both a uh way to cool the
chips but also an efficiency thing all

13112
03:53:49,630 --> 03:53:49,640
chips but also an efficiency thing all
 

13113
03:53:49,640 --> 03:53:51,030
chips but also an efficiency thing all
right and going back to that like sort

13114
03:53:51,030 --> 03:53:51,040
right and going back to that like sort
 

13115
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:53,710
right and going back to that like sort
of three Vector thing right there is um

13116
03:53:53,710 --> 03:53:53,720
of three Vector thing right there is um
 

13117
03:53:53,720 --> 03:53:55,670
of three Vector thing right there is um
there is you know memory bandwidth flops

13118
03:53:55,670 --> 03:53:55,680
there is you know memory bandwidth flops
 

13119
03:53:55,680 --> 03:53:57,550
there is you know memory bandwidth flops
and interconnect the closer the chips

13120
03:53:57,550 --> 03:53:57,560
and interconnect the closer the chips
 

13121
03:53:57,560 --> 03:53:59,910
and interconnect the closer the chips
are together the easier it is to do

13122
03:53:59,910 --> 03:53:59,920
are together the easier it is to do
 

13123
03:53:59,920 --> 03:54:02,910
are together the easier it is to do
high-speed interconnects right uh and so

13124
03:54:02,910 --> 03:54:02,920
high-speed interconnects right uh and so
 

13125
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:04,790
high-speed interconnects right uh and so
this is this is also like a reason why

13126
03:54:04,790 --> 03:54:04,800
this is this is also like a reason why
 

13127
03:54:04,800 --> 03:54:06,110
this is this is also like a reason why
you going to go water cooling is because

13128
03:54:06,110 --> 03:54:06,120
you going to go water cooling is because
 

13129
03:54:06,120 --> 03:54:08,149
you going to go water cooling is because
you can just put the chips right next to

13130
03:54:08,149 --> 03:54:08,159
you can just put the chips right next to
 

13131
03:54:08,159 --> 03:54:10,910
you can just put the chips right next to
each other and therefore get higher uh

13132
03:54:10,910 --> 03:54:10,920
each other and therefore get higher uh
 

13133
03:54:10,920 --> 03:54:12,149
each other and therefore get higher uh
speed

13134
03:54:12,149 --> 03:54:12,159
speed
 

13135
03:54:12,159 --> 03:54:15,189
speed
connectivity I got to ask you so in uh

13136
03:54:15,189 --> 03:54:15,199
connectivity I got to ask you so in uh
 

13137
03:54:15,199 --> 03:54:18,870
connectivity I got to ask you so in uh
one of your uh recent posts there's a

13138
03:54:18,870 --> 03:54:18,880
one of your uh recent posts there's a
 

13139
03:54:18,880 --> 03:54:21,550
one of your uh recent posts there's a
section called cluster measuring contest

13140
03:54:21,550 --> 03:54:21,560
section called cluster measuring contest
 

13141
03:54:21,560 --> 03:54:23,830
section called cluster measuring contest
so uh there's another word there but I

13142
03:54:23,830 --> 03:54:23,840
so uh there's another word there but I
 

13143
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:25,590
so uh there's another word there but I
won't say it you

13144
03:54:25,590 --> 03:54:25,600
won't say it you
 

13145
03:54:25,600 --> 03:54:28,870
won't say it you
know uh what who's who's who's got the

13146
03:54:28,870 --> 03:54:28,880
know uh what who's who's who's got the
 

13147
03:54:28,880 --> 03:54:30,830
know uh what who's who's who's got the
biggest now and who's going to have the

13148
03:54:30,830 --> 03:54:30,840
biggest now and who's going to have the
 

13149
03:54:30,840 --> 03:54:33,670
biggest now and who's going to have the
big today individual largest is Elon

13150
03:54:33,670 --> 03:54:33,680
big today individual largest is Elon
 

13151
03:54:33,680 --> 03:54:37,189
big today individual largest is Elon
right um elon's cluster elon's cluster

13152
03:54:37,189 --> 03:54:37,199
right um elon's cluster elon's cluster
 

13153
03:54:37,199 --> 03:54:40,349
right um elon's cluster elon's cluster
in Memphis 200,000 GPS okay right um

13154
03:54:40,349 --> 03:54:40,359
in Memphis 200,000 GPS okay right um
 

13155
03:54:40,359 --> 03:54:43,070
in Memphis 200,000 GPS okay right um
meta has like 128,000 opena has 100,000

13156
03:54:43,070 --> 03:54:43,080
meta has like 128,000 opena has 100,000

now now to be clear other compies have

13158
03:54:44,790 --> 03:54:44,800
now now to be clear other compies have
 

13159
03:54:44,800 --> 03:54:46,750
now now to be clear other compies have
more gpus than Elon they just don't have

13160
03:54:46,750 --> 03:54:46,760
more gpus than Elon they just don't have
 

13161
03:54:46,760 --> 03:54:48,870
more gpus than Elon they just don't have
them in one place right and for training

13162
03:54:48,870 --> 03:54:48,880
them in one place right and for training
 

13163
03:54:48,880 --> 03:54:50,710
them in one place right and for training
you want them tightly connected there's

13164
03:54:50,710 --> 03:54:50,720
you want them tightly connected there's
 

13165
03:54:50,720 --> 03:54:51,870
you want them tightly connected there's
some techniques that people are

13166
03:54:51,870 --> 03:54:51,880
some techniques that people are
 

13167
03:54:51,880 --> 03:54:54,229
some techniques that people are
researching and working on that let you

13168
03:54:54,229 --> 03:54:54,239
researching and working on that let you
 

13169
03:54:54,239 --> 03:54:56,830
researching and working on that let you
train across multiple regions but for

13170
03:54:56,830 --> 03:54:56,840
train across multiple regions but for
 

13171
03:54:56,840 --> 03:54:58,429
train across multiple regions but for
the most part you want them all in like

13172
03:54:58,429 --> 03:54:58,439
the most part you want them all in like
 

13173
03:54:58,439 --> 03:55:00,389
the most part you want them all in like
one area right so you can connect them

13174
03:55:00,389 --> 03:55:00,399
one area right so you can connect them
 

13175
03:55:00,399 --> 03:55:02,830
one area right so you can connect them
highly with highp speed networking um

13176
03:55:02,830 --> 03:55:02,840
highly with highp speed networking um
 

13177
03:55:02,840 --> 03:55:05,189
highly with highp speed networking um
and so you know Elon today has 200,000

13178
03:55:05,189 --> 03:55:05,199
and so you know Elon today has 200,000
 

13179
03:55:05,199 --> 03:55:07,830
and so you know Elon today has 200,000

h20s right um meta open AI uh you know
 

13183
03:55:12,800 --> 03:55:14,870
h20s right um meta open AI uh you know
and and and Amazon all have on the scale

13184
03:55:14,870 --> 03:55:14,880
and and and Amazon all have on the scale
 

13185
03:55:14,880 --> 03:55:17,670
and and and Amazon all have on the scale
of 100,000 a little bit less um but next

13186
03:55:17,670 --> 03:55:17,680
of 100,000 a little bit less um but next
 

13187
03:55:17,680 --> 03:55:19,149
of 100,000 a little bit less um but next
this year right this year people are

13188
03:55:19,149 --> 03:55:19,159
this year right this year people are
 

13189
03:55:19,159 --> 03:55:20,990
this year right this year people are
building much more right anthropic and

13190
03:55:20,990 --> 03:55:21,000
building much more right anthropic and
 

13191
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:23,149
building much more right anthropic and
Amazon are building a cluster of 400,000

13192
03:55:23,149 --> 03:55:23,159
Amazon are building a cluster of 400,000
 

13193
03:55:23,159 --> 03:55:25,590
Amazon are building a cluster of 400,000
tranium 2 which is Amazon specific chip

13194
03:55:25,590 --> 03:55:25,600
tranium 2 which is Amazon specific chip
 

13195
03:55:25,600 --> 03:55:26,550
tranium 2 which is Amazon specific chip
uh getting trying to get away from

13196
03:55:26,550 --> 03:55:26,560
uh getting trying to get away from
 

13197
03:55:26,560 --> 03:55:31,469
uh getting trying to get away from
Nvidia right um you know uh meta and and

13198
03:55:31,469 --> 03:55:31,479
Nvidia right um you know uh meta and and
 

13199
03:55:31,479 --> 03:55:33,030
Nvidia right um you know uh meta and and
and open AI have scales for hundreds of

13200
03:55:33,030 --> 03:55:33,040
and open AI have scales for hundreds of
 

13201
03:55:33,040 --> 03:55:34,950
and open AI have scales for hundreds of
thousands but by next year you'll have

13202
03:55:34,950 --> 03:55:34,960
thousands but by next year you'll have
 

13203
03:55:34,960 --> 03:55:38,269
thousands but by next year you'll have
like 500,000 to 700,000 GPU clusters and

13204
03:55:38,269 --> 03:55:38,279
like 500,000 to 700,000 GPU clusters and
 

13205
03:55:38,279 --> 03:55:40,309
like 500,000 to 700,000 GPU clusters and
and not those gpus are much higher power

13206
03:55:40,309 --> 03:55:40,319
and not those gpus are much higher power
 

13207
03:55:40,319 --> 03:55:41,790
and not those gpus are much higher power
consumption than existing ones right

13208
03:55:41,790 --> 03:55:41,800
consumption than existing ones right
 

13209
03:55:41,800 --> 03:55:44,389
consumption than existing ones right
Hopper 700 Watts Blackwell goes to 12

13210
03:55:44,389 --> 03:55:44,399
Hopper 700 Watts Blackwell goes to 12
 

13211
03:55:44,399 --> 03:55:46,910
Hopper 700 Watts Blackwell goes to 12
100 Watts right so so the power per chip

13212
03:55:46,910 --> 03:55:46,920
100 Watts right so so the power per chip
 

13213
03:55:46,920 --> 03:55:48,950
100 Watts right so so the power per chip
is growing and the number of chips is

13214
03:55:48,950 --> 03:55:48,960
is growing and the number of chips is
 

13215
03:55:48,960 --> 03:55:51,710
is growing and the number of chips is
growing right NS yeah you think you

13216
03:55:51,710 --> 03:55:51,720
growing right NS yeah you think you
 

13217
03:55:51,720 --> 03:55:53,550
growing right NS yeah you think you
think El Elon said he'll get to a

13218
03:55:53,550 --> 03:55:53,560
think El Elon said he'll get to a
 

13219
03:55:53,560 --> 03:55:55,149
think El Elon said he'll get to a
million you think that's actually

13220
03:55:55,149 --> 03:55:55,159
million you think that's actually
 

13221
03:55:55,159 --> 03:55:57,790
million you think that's actually
feasible um I mean I I I don't doubt

13222
03:55:57,790 --> 03:55:57,800
feasible um I mean I I I don't doubt
 

13223
03:55:57,800 --> 03:56:00,349
feasible um I mean I I I don't doubt
Elon right uh the filings that he has

13224
03:56:00,349 --> 03:56:00,359
Elon right uh the filings that he has
 

13225
03:56:00,359 --> 03:56:02,110
Elon right uh the filings that he has
for like you know the power PL and the

13226
03:56:02,110 --> 03:56:02,120
for like you know the power PL and the
 

13227
03:56:02,120 --> 03:56:03,710
for like you know the power PL and the
Tesla battery packs it's clear he has

13228
03:56:03,710 --> 03:56:03,720
Tesla battery packs it's clear he has
 

13229
03:56:03,720 --> 03:56:05,830
Tesla battery packs it's clear he has
some crazy plans for Memphis um like

13230
03:56:05,830 --> 03:56:05,840
some crazy plans for Memphis um like
 

13231
03:56:05,840 --> 03:56:07,670
some crazy plans for Memphis um like
permits and stuff there's open record

13232
03:56:07,670 --> 03:56:07,680
permits and stuff there's open record
 

13233
03:56:07,680 --> 03:56:10,870
permits and stuff there's open record
right um but it's not quite clear that

13234
03:56:10,870 --> 03:56:10,880
right um but it's not quite clear that
 

13235
03:56:10,880 --> 03:56:12,229
right um but it's not quite clear that
you know what what and what the time

13236
03:56:12,229 --> 03:56:12,239
you know what what and what the time
 

13237
03:56:12,239 --> 03:56:14,790
you know what what and what the time
scales are um I just never

13238
03:56:14,790 --> 03:56:14,800
scales are um I just never
 

13239
03:56:14,800 --> 03:56:15,790
scales are um I just never
right you know that's he's going to

13240
03:56:15,790 --> 03:56:15,800
right you know that's he's going to
 

13241
03:56:15,800 --> 03:56:17,309
right you know that's he's going to
surprise us so what's the idea with

13242
03:56:17,309 --> 03:56:17,319
surprise us so what's the idea with
 

13243
03:56:17,319 --> 03:56:18,750
surprise us so what's the idea with
these clusters if you have a million

13244
03:56:18,750 --> 03:56:18,760
these clusters if you have a million
 

13245
03:56:18,760 --> 03:56:20,550
these clusters if you have a million
gpus what

13246
03:56:20,550 --> 03:56:20,560
gpus what
 

13247
03:56:20,560 --> 03:56:23,469
gpus what
percentage in uh let's say two three

13248
03:56:23,469 --> 03:56:23,479
percentage in uh let's say two three
 

13249
03:56:23,479 --> 03:56:26,910
percentage in uh let's say two three
years is used for uh training and what

13250
03:56:26,910 --> 03:56:26,920
years is used for uh training and what
 

13251
03:56:26,920 --> 03:56:28,670
years is used for uh training and what
percent pre-training and what percent is

13252
03:56:28,670 --> 03:56:28,680
percent pre-training and what percent is
 

13253
03:56:28,680 --> 03:56:31,510
percent pre-training and what percent is
used for like for the actual these Mega

13254
03:56:31,510 --> 03:56:31,520
used for like for the actual these Mega
 

13255
03:56:31,520 --> 03:56:33,510
used for like for the actual these Mega
clusters make no sense for inference

13256
03:56:33,510 --> 03:56:33,520
clusters make no sense for inference
 

13257
03:56:33,520 --> 03:56:35,269
clusters make no sense for inference
right uh you could route inference there

13258
03:56:35,269 --> 03:56:35,279
right uh you could route inference there
 

13259
03:56:35,279 --> 03:56:37,830
right uh you could route inference there
and just not train um but most of the

13260
03:56:37,830 --> 03:56:37,840
and just not train um but most of the
 

13261
03:56:37,840 --> 03:56:39,830
and just not train um but most of the
inference capacity is being you know hey

13262
03:56:39,830 --> 03:56:39,840
inference capacity is being you know hey
 

13263
03:56:39,840 --> 03:56:41,590
inference capacity is being you know hey
I've got a 30 megawatt data center here

13264
03:56:41,590 --> 03:56:41,600
I've got a 30 megawatt data center here
 

13265
03:56:41,600 --> 03:56:43,110
I've got a 30 megawatt data center here
I've got 50 megawatts here I've got 100

I've got 50 megawatts here I've got 100
 

13267
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:44,870
I've got 50 megawatts here I've got 100
here whatever I'll just throw inference

13268
03:56:44,870 --> 03:56:44,880
here whatever I'll just throw inference
 

13269
03:56:44,880 --> 03:56:47,189
here whatever I'll just throw inference
in all of those because the mega

13270
03:56:47,189 --> 03:56:47,199
in all of those because the mega
 

13271
03:56:47,199 --> 03:56:48,950
in all of those because the mega
clusters right multi- gigawatt data

13272
03:56:48,950 --> 03:56:48,960
clusters right multi- gigawatt data
 

13273
03:56:48,960 --> 03:56:50,990

centers I want to train there because

13274
03:56:50,990 --> 03:56:51,000
centers I want to train there because
 

13275
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:52,189
centers I want to train there because
that's where all of my gpus are

13276
03:56:52,189 --> 03:56:52,199
that's where all of my gpus are
 

13277
03:56:52,199 --> 03:56:54,229
that's where all of my gpus are
collocated where I can put them at a

super high networking speed connected
 

13281
03:56:55,920 --> 03:56:57,269
super high networking speed connected
together right because that's what you

13282
03:56:57,269 --> 03:56:57,279
together right because that's what you
 

13283
03:56:57,279 --> 03:56:59,469
together right because that's what you
need for training now with pre-training

13284
03:56:59,469 --> 03:56:59,479
need for training now with pre-training
 

13285
03:56:59,479 --> 03:57:01,070
need for training now with pre-training
this is the old scale right you could

13286
03:57:01,070 --> 03:57:01,080
this is the old scale right you could
 

13287
03:57:01,080 --> 03:57:02,349
this is the old scale right you could
you would increase parameters you

13288
03:57:02,349 --> 03:57:02,359
you would increase parameters you
 

13289
03:57:02,359 --> 03:57:05,309
you would increase parameters you
increase data model gets better uh that

13290
03:57:05,309 --> 03:57:05,319
increase data model gets better uh that
 

13291
03:57:05,319 --> 03:57:06,790
increase data model gets better uh that
doesn't that doesn't apply anymore

13292
03:57:06,790 --> 03:57:06,800
doesn't that doesn't apply anymore
 

13293
03:57:06,800 --> 03:57:08,269
doesn't that doesn't apply anymore
because there's not much more data in

13294
03:57:08,269 --> 03:57:08,279
because there's not much more data in
 

13295
03:57:08,279 --> 03:57:10,389
because there's not much more data in
the pre-training side right uh yes

13296
03:57:10,389 --> 03:57:10,399
the pre-training side right uh yes
 

13297
03:57:10,399 --> 03:57:11,950
the pre-training side right uh yes
there's video and audio and image that

13298
03:57:11,950 --> 03:57:11,960
there's video and audio and image that
 

13299
03:57:11,960 --> 03:57:13,870
there's video and audio and image that
has not been fully taken advantage of so

13300
03:57:13,870 --> 03:57:13,880
has not been fully taken advantage of so
 

13301
03:57:13,880 --> 03:57:15,269
has not been fully taken advantage of so
there's lot more scaling but a lot of

13302
03:57:15,269 --> 03:57:15,279
there's lot more scaling but a lot of
 

13303
03:57:15,279 --> 03:57:17,349
there's lot more scaling but a lot of
people like like uh have have transcript

13304
03:57:17,349 --> 03:57:17,359
people like like uh have have transcript
 

13305
03:57:17,359 --> 03:57:19,030
people like like uh have have transcript
Tak transcripts of YouTube videos and

13306
03:57:19,030 --> 03:57:19,040
Tak transcripts of YouTube videos and
 

13307
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:20,269
Tak transcripts of YouTube videos and
that gets you a lot of the data doesn't

13308
03:57:20,269 --> 03:57:20,279
that gets you a lot of the data doesn't
 

13309
03:57:20,279 --> 03:57:21,670
that gets you a lot of the data doesn't
get you all the learning value out of

13310
03:57:21,670 --> 03:57:21,680
get you all the learning value out of
 

13311
03:57:21,680 --> 03:57:23,349
get you all the learning value out of
the video and image data but you know

13312
03:57:23,349 --> 03:57:23,359
the video and image data but you know
 

13313
03:57:23,359 --> 03:57:24,590
the video and image data but you know
there there's there's still scaling to

13314
03:57:24,590 --> 03:57:24,600
there there's there's still scaling to
 

13315
03:57:24,600 --> 03:57:26,710
there there's there's still scaling to
be done on pre-training uh but this

13316
03:57:26,710 --> 03:57:26,720
be done on pre-training uh but this
 

13317
03:57:26,720 --> 03:57:28,349
be done on pre-training uh but this
posttraining world is where all the

03:57:28,349 --> 03:57:28,359
posttraining world is where all the
 

13319
03:57:28,359 --> 03:57:29,950
posttraining world is where all the
flops are going to be spent right the

03:57:29,950 --> 03:57:29,960
flops are going to be spent right the
 

13321
03:57:29,960 --> 03:57:31,269
flops are going to be spent right the

going to self-play it's going to do

13324

pre-training is when you increase the
 

13375
03:58:17,399 --> 03:58:19,830
pre-training is when you increase the

13376
03:58:19,830 --> 03:58:19,840
context length for these models and
 

13377
03:58:19,840 --> 03:58:21,389

we've talked earlier in the conversation

13378
03:58:21,389 --> 03:58:21,399
we've talked earlier in the conversation
 

13379
03:58:21,399 --> 03:58:23,189
we've talked earlier in the conversation
about how the context length when you

13380
03:58:23,189 --> 03:58:23,199
about how the context length when you
 

13381
03:58:23,199 --> 03:58:24,950
about how the context length when you
have a long input is much easier to

13382
03:58:24,950 --> 03:58:24,960
have a long input is much easier to
 

13383
03:58:24,960 --> 03:58:26,670
have a long input is much easier to
manage than output and a lot of these

post trainining and reasoning techniques

13386
03:58:28,110 --> 03:58:28,120
post trainining and reasoning techniques
 

13387
03:58:28,120 --> 03:58:30,870
post trainining and reasoning techniques
rely on a ton of sampling and it's

13388
03:58:30,870 --> 03:58:30,880
rely on a ton of sampling and it's
 

13389
03:58:30,880 --> 03:58:33,070
rely on a ton of sampling and it's
becoming increasingly long context so

13390
03:58:33,070 --> 03:58:33,080
becoming increasingly long context so
 

13391
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:35,349
becoming increasingly long context so
it's just like your effectively your

13392
03:58:35,349 --> 03:58:35,359
it's just like your effectively your
 

13393
03:58:35,359 --> 03:58:38,110
it's just like your effectively your
compute efficiency goes down I don't the

13394
03:58:38,110 --> 03:58:38,120
compute efficiency goes down I don't the
 

13395
03:58:38,120 --> 03:58:40,349
compute efficiency goes down I don't the
flops is the standard for how you

13396
03:58:40,349 --> 03:58:40,359
flops is the standard for how you
 

13397
03:58:40,359 --> 03:58:42,590
flops is the standard for how you
measure it but with RL and you have to

13398
03:58:42,590 --> 03:58:42,600
measure it but with RL and you have to
 

13399
03:58:42,600 --> 03:58:44,670
measure it but with RL and you have to
do all these things where you move your

13400
03:58:44,670 --> 03:58:44,680
do all these things where you move your
 

13401
03:58:44,680 --> 03:58:46,469
do all these things where you move your
weights around in a different way than

13402
03:58:46,469 --> 03:58:46,479
weights around in a different way than
 

13403
03:58:46,479 --> 03:58:50,149
weights around in a different way than
at pre-training and just generation it's

13404
03:58:50,149 --> 03:58:50,159
at pre-training and just generation it's
 

13405
03:58:50,159 --> 03:58:51,950
at pre-training and just generation it's
going to become less efficient and flops

13406
03:58:51,950 --> 03:58:51,960
going to become less efficient and flops
 

13407
03:58:51,960 --> 03:58:53,870
going to become less efficient and flops
is going to be less of a useful term and

13408
03:58:53,870 --> 03:58:53,880
is going to be less of a useful term and
 

13409
03:58:53,880 --> 03:58:55,149
is going to be less of a useful term and
then as the infrastructure gets better

13410
03:58:55,149 --> 03:58:55,159
then as the infrastructure gets better
 

13411
03:58:55,159 --> 03:58:57,030
then as the infrastructure gets better
it's probably going to go back to flops

13412
03:58:57,030 --> 03:58:57,040
it's probably going to go back to flops
 

13413
03:58:57,040 --> 03:58:58,790
it's probably going to go back to flops
so all of the things we've been talking

13414
03:58:58,790 --> 03:58:58,800
so all of the things we've been talking
 

13415
03:58:58,800 --> 03:59:01,670
so all of the things we've been talking
about is most likely going to be Nvidia

13416
03:59:01,670 --> 03:59:01,680
about is most likely going to be Nvidia
 

13417
03:59:01,680 --> 03:59:03,790
about is most likely going to be Nvidia
right is there any competitors Google

13418
03:59:03,790 --> 03:59:03,800
right is there any competitors Google
 

13419
03:59:03,800 --> 03:59:06,910
right is there any competitors Google
Google I kind of ignored them 's the

13420
03:59:06,910 --> 03:59:06,920
Google I kind of ignored them 's the
 

13421
03:59:06,920 --> 03:59:09,469
Google I kind of ignored them 's the
story with what's the story with TPU

13422
03:59:09,469 --> 03:59:09,479
story with what's the story with TPU
 

13423
03:59:09,479 --> 03:59:12,110
story with what's the story with TPU
like what's the TPU is is awesome right

13424
03:59:12,110 --> 03:59:12,120
like what's the TPU is is awesome right
 

13425
03:59:12,120 --> 03:59:15,429
like what's the TPU is is awesome right
it's great uh Google is they're a bit

13426
03:59:15,429 --> 03:59:15,439
it's great uh Google is they're a bit
 

13427
03:59:15,439 --> 03:59:16,950
it's great uh Google is they're a bit
more tepid on building data centers for

13428
03:59:16,950 --> 03:59:16,960
more tepid on building data centers for
 

13429
03:59:16,960 --> 03:59:18,070
more tepid on building data centers for
some reason they're they're building Big

13430
03:59:18,070 --> 03:59:18,080
some reason they're they're building Big
 

13431
03:59:18,080 --> 03:59:19,670
some reason they're they're building Big
Data Centers don't get me wrong and they

13432
03:59:19,670 --> 03:59:19,680
Data Centers don't get me wrong and they
 

13433
03:59:19,680 --> 03:59:20,790
Data Centers don't get me wrong and they
have they actually have the biggest

13434
03:59:20,790 --> 03:59:20,800
have they actually have the biggest
 

13435
03:59:20,800 --> 03:59:22,469
have they actually have the biggest
cluster let me I I I was talking about

13436
03:59:22,469 --> 03:59:22,479
cluster let me I I I was talking about
 

13437
03:59:22,479 --> 03:59:23,910
cluster let me I I I was talking about
Nvidia clusters they actually have the

13438
03:59:23,910 --> 03:59:23,920
Nvidia clusters they actually have the
 

13439
03:59:23,920 --> 03:59:26,189
Nvidia clusters they actually have the
biggest cluster period um but the way

13440
03:59:26,189 --> 03:59:26,199
biggest cluster period um but the way
 

13441
03:59:26,199 --> 03:59:27,750
biggest cluster period um but the way
they do it is like very interesting

13442
03:59:27,750 --> 03:59:27,760
they do it is like very interesting
 

13443
03:59:27,760 --> 03:59:30,309
they do it is like very interesting
right um they have two sort of like data

13444
03:59:30,309 --> 03:59:30,319
right um they have two sort of like data
 

13445
03:59:30,319 --> 03:59:32,790
right um they have two sort of like data
center super regions right in that the

13446
03:59:32,790 --> 03:59:32,800
center super regions right in that the
 

13447
03:59:32,800 --> 03:59:34,670
center super regions right in that the
data center isn't physically like all of

13448
03:59:34,670 --> 03:59:34,680
data center isn't physically like all of
 

13449
03:59:34,680 --> 03:59:36,349
data center isn't physically like all of
the gpus aren't physically on one site

13450
03:59:36,349 --> 03:59:36,359
the gpus aren't physically on one site
 

13451
03:59:36,359 --> 03:59:37,429
the gpus aren't physically on one site
but they're like 30 miles from each

13452
03:59:37,429 --> 03:59:37,439
but they're like 30 miles from each
 

13453
03:59:37,439 --> 03:59:39,389
but they're like 30 miles from each
other and not gpus TPS right they have

13454
03:59:39,389 --> 03:59:39,399
other and not gpus TPS right they have
 

13455
03:59:39,399 --> 03:59:41,510
other and not gpus TPS right they have
like in in Iowa and Nebraska they have

13456
03:59:41,510 --> 03:59:41,520
like in in Iowa and Nebraska they have
 

13457
03:59:41,520 --> 03:59:42,950
like in in Iowa and Nebraska they have
four data centers that are just like

13458
03:59:42,950 --> 03:59:42,960
four data centers that are just like
 

13459
03:59:42,960 --> 03:59:45,229
four data centers that are just like
right next to each other why doesn't

13460
03:59:45,229 --> 03:59:45,239
right next to each other why doesn't
 

13461
03:59:45,239 --> 03:59:48,750
right next to each other why doesn't
Google Flex its cluster size go to multi

13462
03:59:48,750 --> 03:59:48,760

data center training it's a good images

13464
03:59:50,349 --> 03:59:50,359

13465
03:59:50,359 --> 03:59:51,750

Google data center looks like by the way
their data centers look very different

13476
04:00:00,469 --> 04:00:00,479
their data centers look very different
 

13477
04:00:00,479 --> 04:00:02,110
their data centers look very different
than anyone else's data centers what are

13478
04:00:02,110 --> 04:00:02,120
than anyone else's data centers what are
 

13479
04:00:02,120 --> 04:00:03,750
than anyone else's data centers what are
we looking at here um so these are yeah

13480
04:00:03,750 --> 04:00:03,760
we looking at here um so these are yeah
 

13481
04:00:03,760 --> 04:00:05,830
we looking at here um so these are yeah
so if you if you see this image right in

13482
04:00:05,830 --> 04:00:05,840
so if you if you see this image right in
 

13483
04:00:05,840 --> 04:00:06,910
so if you if you see this image right in
the center there are these big

13484
04:00:06,910 --> 04:00:06,920
the center there are these big
 

13485
04:00:06,920 --> 04:00:08,950
the center there are these big
rectangular boxes right those are where

13486
04:00:08,950 --> 04:00:08,960
rectangular boxes right those are where
 

13487
04:00:08,960 --> 04:00:11,389
rectangular boxes right those are where
the actual chips are kept um and then if

13488
04:00:11,389 --> 04:00:11,399
the actual chips are kept um and then if
 

13489
04:00:11,399 --> 04:00:13,389
the actual chips are kept um and then if
you scroll down a little bit further um

13490
04:00:13,389 --> 04:00:13,399
you scroll down a little bit further um
 

13491
04:00:13,399 --> 04:00:15,590
you scroll down a little bit further um
you you can see there's like these water

13492
04:00:15,590 --> 04:00:15,600
you you can see there's like these water
 

13493
04:00:15,600 --> 04:00:17,309
you you can see there's like these water
pipes there's these Chiller cooling

13494
04:00:17,309 --> 04:00:17,319
pipes there's these Chiller cooling
 

13495
04:00:17,319 --> 04:00:19,149
pipes there's these Chiller cooling
towers in the top and a bunch of like

13496
04:00:19,149 --> 04:00:19,159
towers in the top and a bunch of like
 

13497
04:00:19,159 --> 04:00:20,830
towers in the top and a bunch of like
diesel generators the diesel generators

13498
04:00:20,830 --> 04:00:20,840
diesel generators the diesel generators
 

13499
04:00:20,840 --> 04:00:23,710
diesel generators the diesel generators
are backup power the data center itself

13500
04:00:23,710 --> 04:00:23,720
are backup power the data center itself
 

13501
04:00:23,720 --> 04:00:25,990
are backup power the data center itself
is like look physically smaller than the

13502
04:00:25,990 --> 04:00:26,000
is like look physically smaller than the
 

13503
04:00:26,000 --> 04:00:27,590
is like look physically smaller than the
water chillers right so the chips are

13504
04:00:27,590 --> 04:00:27,600
water chillers right so the chips are
 

13505
04:00:27,600 --> 04:00:29,670
water chillers right so the chips are
actually easier to like keep together

13506
04:00:29,670 --> 04:00:29,680
actually easier to like keep together
 

13507
04:00:29,680 --> 04:00:31,110
actually easier to like keep together
but then like cooling all the water for

13508
04:00:31,110 --> 04:00:31,120
but then like cooling all the water for
 

13509
04:00:31,120 --> 04:00:33,030
but then like cooling all the water for
the water cooling is very difficult

13510
04:00:33,030 --> 04:00:33,040
the water cooling is very difficult
 

13511
04:00:33,040 --> 04:00:34,750
the water cooling is very difficult
right so Google has like a very Advanced

13512
04:00:34,750 --> 04:00:34,760
right so Google has like a very Advanced
 

13513
04:00:34,760 --> 04:00:36,710
right so Google has like a very Advanced
infrastructure that no one else has for

13514
04:00:36,710 --> 04:00:36,720
infrastructure that no one else has for
 

13515
04:00:36,720 --> 04:00:39,189
infrastructure that no one else has for
the TPU um and what they do is they've

13516
04:00:39,189 --> 04:00:39,199
the TPU um and what they do is they've
 

13517
04:00:39,199 --> 04:00:40,710
the TPU um and what they do is they've
like stamped these data center they've

13518
04:00:40,710 --> 04:00:40,720
like stamped these data center they've
 

13519
04:00:40,720 --> 04:00:41,910
like stamped these data center they've
stamped a bunch of these data centers

13520
04:00:41,910 --> 04:00:41,920
stamped a bunch of these data centers
 

13521
04:00:41,920 --> 04:00:44,030
stamped a bunch of these data centers
out in a few regions right so if you go

13522
04:00:44,030 --> 04:00:44,040
out in a few regions right so if you go
 

13523
04:00:44,040 --> 04:00:46,830
out in a few regions right so if you go
a little bit further um down uh this is

13524
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:46,840
a little bit further um down uh this is
 

13525
04:00:46,840 --> 04:00:48,389
a little bit further um down uh this is
this is a Microsoft this is an Arizona

13526
04:00:48,389 --> 04:00:48,399
this is a Microsoft this is an Arizona
 

13527
04:00:48,399 --> 04:00:50,070
this is a Microsoft this is an Arizona
this is where GPT 5 quote unquote will

13528
04:00:50,070 --> 04:00:50,080
this is where GPT 5 quote unquote will
 

13529
04:00:50,080 --> 04:00:53,510
this is where GPT 5 quote unquote will
be trained um you know uh if it doesn't

13530
04:00:53,510 --> 04:00:53,520
be trained um you know uh if it doesn't
 

13531
04:00:53,520 --> 04:00:55,309
be trained um you know uh if it doesn't
exist already yeah if it doesn't exist

13532
04:00:55,309 --> 04:00:55,319
exist already yeah if it doesn't exist
 

13533
04:00:55,319 --> 04:00:57,030
exist already yeah if it doesn't exist
already um but each of these data

13534
04:00:57,030 --> 04:00:57,040
already um but each of these data
 

13535
04:00:57,040 --> 04:00:58,670
already um but each of these data
centers right I've shown a couple images

13536
04:00:58,670 --> 04:00:58,680
centers right I've shown a couple images
 

13537
04:00:58,680 --> 04:01:00,309
centers right I've shown a couple images
of them they're like really closely

13538
04:01:00,309 --> 04:01:00,319
of them they're like really closely
 

13539
04:01:00,319 --> 04:01:02,149
of them they're like really closely
collocated in the same region right

13540
04:01:02,149 --> 04:01:02,159
collocated in the same region right
 

13541
04:01:02,159 --> 04:01:03,670
collocated in the same region right
Nebraska Iowa and then they also have a

13542
04:01:03,670 --> 04:01:03,680
Nebraska Iowa and then they also have a
 

13543
04:01:03,680 --> 04:01:06,870
Nebraska Iowa and then they also have a
similar one in uh Ohio complex right um

13544
04:01:06,870 --> 04:01:06,880
similar one in uh Ohio complex right um
 

13545
04:01:06,880 --> 04:01:08,229
similar one in uh Ohio complex right um
and so these data centers are really

13546
04:01:08,229 --> 04:01:08,239
and so these data centers are really
 

13547
04:01:08,239 --> 04:01:10,030
and so these data centers are really
close to each other um and what they've

13548
04:01:10,030 --> 04:01:10,040
close to each other um and what they've
 

13549
04:01:10,040 --> 04:01:11,309
close to each other um and what they've
done is they've connected them super

13550
04:01:11,309 --> 04:01:11,319
done is they've connected them super
 

13551
04:01:11,319 --> 04:01:13,630
done is they've connected them super
high bandwidth with fiber um and so

13552
04:01:13,630 --> 04:01:13,640
high bandwidth with fiber um and so
 

13553
04:01:13,640 --> 04:01:14,990
high bandwidth with fiber um and so
these are just a bunch of data centers

13554
04:01:14,990 --> 04:01:15,000
these are just a bunch of data centers
 

13555
04:01:15,000 --> 04:01:16,750
these are just a bunch of data centers
and and and the point here is that

13556
04:01:16,750 --> 04:01:16,760
and and and the point here is that
 

13557
04:01:16,760 --> 04:01:18,429
and and and the point here is that
Google has a very Advanced

13558
04:01:18,429 --> 04:01:18,439
Google has a very Advanced
 

13559
04:01:18,439 --> 04:01:20,590
Google has a very Advanced
infrastructure um very tightly connected

13560
04:01:20,590 --> 04:01:20,600
infrastructure um very tightly connected
 

13561
04:01:20,600 --> 04:01:22,550
infrastructure um very tightly connected
in a small region so Elon always always

13562
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:22,560
in a small region so Elon always always
 

13563
04:01:22,560 --> 04:01:24,030
in a small region so Elon always always
to have the biggest cluster fully

13564
04:01:24,030 --> 04:01:24,040
to have the biggest cluster fully
 

13565
04:01:24,040 --> 04:01:25,750
to have the biggest cluster fully
connected right because it's all in one

13566
04:01:25,750 --> 04:01:25,760
connected right because it's all in one
 

13567
04:01:25,760 --> 04:01:27,590
connected right because it's all in one
building yeah right and he's completely

13568
04:01:27,590 --> 04:01:27,600
building yeah right and he's completely
 

13569
04:01:27,600 --> 04:01:29,790
building yeah right and he's completely
right on that right Google has the

13570
04:01:29,790 --> 04:01:29,800
right on that right Google has the
 

13571
04:01:29,800 --> 04:01:31,229
right on that right Google has the
biggest cluster but you have to spread

13572
04:01:31,229 --> 04:01:31,239
biggest cluster but you have to spread
 

13573
04:01:31,239 --> 04:01:33,189
biggest cluster but you have to spread
over three s and by by a significant

13574
04:01:33,189 --> 04:01:33,199
over three s and by by a significant
 

13575
04:01:33,199 --> 04:01:34,710
over three s and by by a significant
margin but you have to go across

13576
04:01:34,710 --> 04:01:34,720
margin but you have to go across
 

13577
04:01:34,720 --> 04:01:37,149
margin but you have to go across
multiple sites why doesn't Google

13578
04:01:37,149 --> 04:01:37,159
multiple sites why doesn't Google
 

13579
04:01:37,159 --> 04:01:40,790
multiple sites why doesn't Google
compete with Invidia why don't they sell

13580
04:01:40,790 --> 04:01:40,800
compete with Invidia why don't they sell
 

13581
04:01:40,800 --> 04:01:43,110
compete with Invidia why don't they sell
tpus I think I think there's a couple

13582
04:01:43,110 --> 04:01:43,120
tpus I think I think there's a couple
 

13583
04:01:43,120 --> 04:01:46,110
tpus I think I think there's a couple
problems with it it's like one TPU has

13584
04:01:46,110 --> 04:01:46,120
problems with it it's like one TPU has
 

13585
04:01:46,120 --> 04:01:49,910
problems with it it's like one TPU has
been a form of allowing search to be

13586
04:01:49,910 --> 04:01:49,920
been a form of allowing search to be
 

13587
04:01:49,920 --> 04:01:52,309
been a form of allowing search to be
really freaking cheap and build models

13588
04:01:52,309 --> 04:01:52,319
really freaking cheap and build models
 

13589
04:01:52,319 --> 04:01:54,429
really freaking cheap and build models
for that right um and so like a big

13590
04:01:54,429 --> 04:01:54,439
for that right um and so like a big
 

13591
04:01:54,439 --> 04:01:56,670
for that right um and so like a big
chunk of the search GPU purchases or TPU

13592
04:01:56,670 --> 04:01:56,680
chunk of the search GPU purchases or TPU
 

13593
04:01:56,680 --> 04:01:58,870
chunk of the search GPU purchases or TPU
purchases or big chunk of Google's

13594
04:01:58,870 --> 04:01:58,880
purchases or big chunk of Google's
 

13595
04:01:58,880 --> 04:02:01,229
purchases or big chunk of Google's
purchases and usage all of it is for

13596
04:02:01,229 --> 04:02:01,239
purchases and usage all of it is for
 

13597
04:02:01,239 --> 04:02:02,750
purchases and usage all of it is for
internal workloads right whether it be

13598
04:02:02,750 --> 04:02:02,760
internal workloads right whether it be
 

13599
04:02:02,760 --> 04:02:06,510
internal workloads right whether it be
search uh now Gemini right uh YouTube um

13600
04:02:06,510 --> 04:02:06,520
search uh now Gemini right uh YouTube um
 

13601
04:02:06,520 --> 04:02:07,790
search uh now Gemini right uh YouTube um
all these different applications that

13602
04:02:07,790 --> 04:02:07,800
all these different applications that
 

13603
04:02:07,800 --> 04:02:10,630
all these different applications that
they have uh you know ads um these are

13604
04:02:10,630 --> 04:02:10,640
they have uh you know ads um these are
 

13605
04:02:10,640 --> 04:02:12,030
they have uh you know ads um these are
where all their tpus are being spent and

13606
04:02:12,030 --> 04:02:12,040
where all their tpus are being spent and
 

13607
04:02:12,040 --> 04:02:13,189
where all their tpus are being spent and
that's what they're hyperfocused on

13608
04:02:13,189 --> 04:02:13,199
that's what they're hyperfocused on
 

13609
04:02:13,199 --> 04:02:15,670
that's what they're hyperfocused on
right um and so there's certain like

13610
04:02:15,670 --> 04:02:15,680
right um and so there's certain like
 

13611
04:02:15,680 --> 04:02:17,269
right um and so there's certain like
aspects of the architecture that are

13612
04:02:17,269 --> 04:02:17,279
aspects of the architecture that are
 

13613
04:02:17,279 --> 04:02:18,830
aspects of the architecture that are
optimized for their use case that are

13614
04:02:18,830 --> 04:02:18,840
optimized for their use case that are
 

13615
04:02:18,840 --> 04:02:21,670
optimized for their use case that are
not optimized elsewhere right one simple

13616
04:02:21,670 --> 04:02:21,680
not optimized elsewhere right one simple
 

13617
04:02:21,680 --> 04:02:22,990
not optimized elsewhere right one simple
one is like they've open sourced the

13618
04:02:22,990 --> 04:02:23,000
one is like they've open sourced the
 

13619
04:02:23,000 --> 04:02:24,950
one is like they've open sourced the
Gemma model and and they called it Gemma

13620
04:02:24,950 --> 04:02:24,960
Gemma model and and they called it Gemma
 

13621
04:02:24,960 --> 04:02:27,030
Gemma model and and they called it Gemma
7B right uh but then it's actually 8

13622
04:02:27,030 --> 04:02:27,040
7B right uh but then it's actually 8
 

13623
04:02:27,040 --> 04:02:28,149
7B right uh but then it's actually 8
billion parameters because the

13624
04:02:28,149 --> 04:02:28,159
billion parameters because the
 

13625
04:02:28,159 --> 04:02:30,389
billion parameters because the
vocabulary is so large because and the

13626
04:02:30,389 --> 04:02:30,399
vocabulary is so large because and the
 

13627
04:02:30,399 --> 04:02:31,990
vocabulary is so large because and the
reason they made the vocabulary so large

13628
04:02:31,990 --> 04:02:32,000
reason they made the vocabulary so large
 

13629
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:34,389
reason they made the vocabulary so large
is because tpus like Matrix multiply

13630
04:02:34,389 --> 04:02:34,399
is because tpus like Matrix multiply
 

13631
04:02:34,399 --> 04:02:36,510
is because tpus like Matrix multiply
unit is massive because that's what

13632
04:02:36,510 --> 04:02:36,520
unit is massive because that's what
 

13633
04:02:36,520 --> 04:02:37,910
unit is massive because that's what
they've like sort of optimized for and

13634
04:02:37,910 --> 04:02:37,920
they've like sort of optimized for and
 

13635
04:02:37,920 --> 04:02:39,189
they've like sort of optimized for and
so they decided oh I'll just make the

13636
04:02:39,189 --> 04:02:39,199
so they decided oh I'll just make the
 

13637
04:02:39,199 --> 04:02:40,870
so they decided oh I'll just make the
vocabulary large too even though it

13638
04:02:40,870 --> 04:02:40,880
vocabulary large too even though it
 

13639
04:02:40,880 --> 04:02:42,349
vocabulary large too even though it
makes no sense to do so on such a small

13640
04:02:42,349 --> 04:02:42,359
makes no sense to do so on such a small
 

13641
04:02:42,359 --> 04:02:43,950
makes no sense to do so on such a small
model because that fits on their hard

13642
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:43,960
model because that fits on their hard
 

13643
04:02:43,960 --> 04:02:45,990
model because that fits on their hard
Ware so Gemma doesn't run as efficiently

small portions of it Jackson xlaa have
 

13673
04:03:13,439 --> 04:03:15,630
small portions of it Jackson xlaa have
been but like the experience when you're

13674
04:03:15,630 --> 04:03:15,640
been but like the experience when you're
 

13675
04:03:15,640 --> 04:03:17,030
been but like the experience when you're
inside of Google and you're training on

04:03:17,030 --> 04:03:17,040
inside of Google and you're training on
 

13677
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:18,950
inside of Google and you're training on
tpus as a researcher you don't need to

04:03:18,950 --> 04:03:18,960
tpus as a researcher you don't need to
 

13679

04:03:20,269 --> 04:03:20,279
know anything about the hardware in many
 

13681
04:03:20,279 --> 04:03:21,910
know anything about the hardware in many
cases right like it's like pretty

13682
04:03:21,910 --> 04:03:21,920
cases right like it's like pretty
 

13683
04:03:21,920 --> 04:03:23,790
cases right like it's like pretty
beautiful but as soon as you step

13684
04:03:23,790 --> 04:03:23,800
beautiful but as soon as you step
 

13685
04:03:23,800 --> 04:03:25,670
beautiful but as soon as you step
outside they they all go a lot of them

13686
04:03:25,670 --> 04:03:25,680
outside they they all go a lot of them
 

13687
04:03:25,680 --> 04:03:27,950
outside they they all go a lot of them
go back they leave Google and then they

13688
04:03:27,950 --> 04:03:27,960
go back they leave Google and then they
 

13689
04:03:27,960 --> 04:03:29,990
go back they leave Google and then they
go back yeah yeah they're like they they

13690
04:03:29,990 --> 04:03:30,000
go back yeah yeah they're like they they
 

13691
04:03:30,000 --> 04:03:31,189
go back yeah yeah they're like they they
leave and they start a company because

13692
04:03:31,189 --> 04:03:31,199
leave and they start a company because
 

13693
04:03:31,199 --> 04:03:32,189
leave and they start a company because
they have all these amazing research

13694
04:03:32,189 --> 04:03:32,199
they have all these amazing research
 

13695
04:03:32,199 --> 04:03:33,309
they have all these amazing research
ideas and they're like wait

13696
04:03:33,309 --> 04:03:33,319
ideas and they're like wait
 

13697
04:03:33,319 --> 04:03:35,590
ideas and they're like wait
infrastructure is hard software is hard

13698
04:03:35,590 --> 04:03:35,600
infrastructure is hard software is hard
 

13699
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:37,070
infrastructure is hard software is hard
and this is on gpus or if they try to

13700
04:03:37,070 --> 04:03:37,080
and this is on gpus or if they try to
 

13701
04:03:37,080 --> 04:03:38,269
and this is on gpus or if they try to
use tpus same thing because they don't

13702
04:03:38,269 --> 04:03:38,279
use tpus same thing because they don't
 

13703
04:03:38,279 --> 04:03:40,269
use tpus same thing because they don't
have access to all this code and so it's

13704
04:03:40,269 --> 04:03:40,279
have access to all this code and so it's
 

13705
04:03:40,279 --> 04:03:41,950
have access to all this code and so it's
like how do you convince a company whose

13706
04:03:41,950 --> 04:03:41,960
like how do you convince a company whose
 

13707
04:03:41,960 --> 04:03:43,349
like how do you convince a company whose
Golden Goose is search where they're

Golden Goose is search where they're
 

13709
04:03:43,359 --> 04:03:45,070

04:03:45,070 --> 04:03:45,080
making hundreds of billions of dollars
 

13711
04:03:45,080 --> 04:03:48,750
making hundreds of billions of dollars
from to start selling GPU or tpus uh

13712
04:03:48,750 --> 04:03:48,760
from to start selling GPU or tpus uh
 

13713
04:03:48,760 --> 04:03:49,990
from to start selling GPU or tpus uh
which they used to only buy a couple

13714
04:03:49,990 --> 04:03:50,000
which they used to only buy a couple
 

13715
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:51,990
which they used to only buy a couple
billion of you know I think in 20203

13716
04:03:51,990 --> 04:03:52,000
billion of you know I think in 20203
 

13717
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:54,710
billion of you know I think in 20203
they bought like um like a couple

13718
04:03:54,710 --> 04:03:54,720
they bought like um like a couple
 

13719
04:03:54,720 --> 04:03:56,469
they bought like um like a couple
billion and now they're buying like 10

13720
04:03:56,469 --> 04:03:56,479
billion and now they're buying like 10
 

13721
04:03:56,479 --> 04:03:58,389
billion and now they're buying like 10
billion to$ 15 billion worth but how do

13722
04:03:58,389 --> 04:03:58,399
billion to$ 15 billion worth but how do
 

13723
04:03:58,399 --> 04:03:59,550
billion to$ 15 billion worth but how do
you convince them that they could they

13724
04:03:59,550 --> 04:03:59,560
you convince them that they could they
 

13725
04:03:59,560 --> 04:04:01,070
you convince them that they could they
should just buy like twice as many and

13726
04:04:01,070 --> 04:04:01,080
should just buy like twice as many and
 

13727
04:04:01,080 --> 04:04:02,670
should just buy like twice as many and
figure out how to sell them and make $30

13728
04:04:02,670 --> 04:04:02,680
figure out how to sell them and make $30
 

13729
04:04:02,680 --> 04:04:04,389
figure out how to sell them and make $30
billion like who cares about making $30

13730
04:04:04,389 --> 04:04:04,399
billion like who cares about making $30
 

13731
04:04:04,399 --> 04:04:08,030
billion like who cares about making $30
billion won't that 30 billion exceed

13732
04:04:08,030 --> 04:04:08,040
billion won't that 30 billion exceed
 

13733

actually the search profit eventually oh

13734
04:04:10,750 --> 04:04:10,760
actually the search profit eventually oh

04:04:10,760 --> 04:04:12,349
actually the search profit eventually oh
I mean like you're always going to make

13736
04:04:12,349 --> 04:04:12,359
I mean like you're always going to make
 

13737
04:04:12,359 --> 04:04:15,710
I mean like you're always going to make
more money on Services than than than I

13738
04:04:15,710 --> 04:04:15,720
more money on Services than than than I
 

13739
04:04:15,720 --> 04:04:17,550
more money on Services than than than I
mean like yeah like you like to be clear

13740
04:04:17,550 --> 04:04:17,560
mean like yeah like you like to be clear
 

13741
04:04:17,560 --> 04:04:18,750
mean like yeah like you like to be clear
like today people are spending a lot

13742
04:04:18,750 --> 04:04:18,760
like today people are spending a lot
 

13743
04:04:18,760 --> 04:04:20,429
like today people are spending a lot
more on Hardware than they are the

13744
04:04:20,429 --> 04:04:20,439
more on Hardware than they are the
 

13745
04:04:20,439 --> 04:04:23,429
more on Hardware than they are the
services right because you the hardware

13746
04:04:23,429 --> 04:04:23,439
services right because you the hardware
 

13747
04:04:23,439 --> 04:04:25,830
services right because you the hardware
front runs the service spend but like

13748
04:04:25,830 --> 04:04:25,840
front runs the service spend but like
 

13749
04:04:25,840 --> 04:04:27,870
front runs the service spend but like
you're investing if if if there's no

13750
04:04:27,870 --> 04:04:27,880
you're investing if if if there's no
 

13751
04:04:27,880 --> 04:04:29,309
you're investing if if if there's no
revenue for AI stuff or not enough

13752
04:04:29,309 --> 04:04:29,319
revenue for AI stuff or not enough
 

13753
04:04:29,319 --> 04:04:30,389
revenue for AI stuff or not enough
Revenue then obviously like it's going

13754
04:04:30,389 --> 04:04:30,399
Revenue then obviously like it's going
 

13755
04:04:30,399 --> 04:04:32,070
Revenue then obviously like it's going
to blow up right you know uh people

13756
04:04:32,070 --> 04:04:32,080
to blow up right you know uh people
 

13757
04:04:32,080 --> 04:04:34,149
to blow up right you know uh people
won't continue to spend on gpus forever

13758
04:04:34,149 --> 04:04:34,159
won't continue to spend on gpus forever
 

13759
04:04:34,159 --> 04:04:35,750
won't continue to spend on gpus forever
um and Nvidia is trying to move up the

and Microsoft uh deceptively sort of
 

13829
04:05:45,239 --> 04:05:47,349
and Microsoft uh deceptively sort of
includes like Microsoft Office 365 and

enterprise-wide licenses so in reality
 

13835
04:05:50,800 --> 04:05:52,389
enterprise-wide licenses so in reality
the gulf is even larger Microsoft is

13836
04:05:52,389 --> 04:05:52,399
the gulf is even larger Microsoft is
 

13837
04:05:52,399 --> 04:05:54,510
the gulf is even larger Microsoft is
still second though right um Amazon is

13838
04:05:54,510 --> 04:05:54,520
still second though right um Amazon is
 

13839
04:05:54,520 --> 04:05:56,790
still second though right um Amazon is
way bigger why because using AWS is

13840
04:05:56,790 --> 04:05:56,800
way bigger why because using AWS is
 

13841
04:05:56,800 --> 04:05:58,790
way bigger why because using AWS is
better and easier and in many cases it's

13842
04:05:58,790 --> 04:05:58,800
better and easier and in many cases it's
 

13843
04:05:58,800 --> 04:06:00,750
better and easier and in many cases it's
cheaper and it's first it was first yeah

13844
04:06:00,750 --> 04:06:00,760
cheaper and it's first it was first yeah
 

13845
04:06:00,760 --> 04:06:01,750
cheaper and it's first it was first yeah
but there's a lot of things that are

13846
04:06:01,750 --> 04:06:01,760
but there's a lot of things that are
 

13847
04:06:01,760 --> 04:06:04,389
but there's a lot of things that are
first that well it's easier it's harder

13848
04:06:04,389 --> 04:06:04,399
first that well it's easier it's harder
 

13849
04:06:04,399 --> 04:06:08,110
first that well it's easier it's harder

04:06:48,510 --> 04:06:48,520
Amazon has always optimized for the
 

13893
04:06:48,520 --> 04:06:49,670
Amazon has always optimized for the
small customer too though right like

13894
04:06:49,670 --> 04:06:49,680
small customer too though right like
 

13895
04:06:49,680 --> 04:06:50,830
small customer too though right like

big customer but like when they started
 

13899
04:06:52,920 --> 04:06:54,429
big customer but like when they started

is snowflake all over Amazon because
 

13915
04:07:06,359 --> 04:07:07,710
is snowflake all over Amazon because
snowflake in the beginning when Amazon

13916
04:07:07,710 --> 04:07:07,720
snowflake in the beginning when Amazon
 

13917
04:07:07,720 --> 04:07:09,550
snowflake in the beginning when Amazon
didn't care about them was still using

13918

Amazon right and then of course one day

13920
04:07:10,870 --> 04:07:10,880
Amazon right and then of course one day
 

13921
04:07:10,880 --> 04:07:12,550
Amazon right and then of course one day
Snowflake and Amazon has a super huge

04:07:17,830 --> 04:07:17,840
quality is better also a lot of the
 

13929
04:07:17,840 --> 04:07:19,750
quality is better also a lot of the
Silicon they've engineered makes them

13930
04:07:19,750 --> 04:07:19,760
Silicon they've engineered makes them
 

13931
04:07:19,760 --> 04:07:20,910
Silicon they've engineered makes them
have a lower cost structure and

13932
04:07:20,910 --> 04:07:20,920
have a lower cost structure and
 

13933
04:07:20,920 --> 04:07:23,349
have a lower cost structure and
traditional cloud storage CPU networking

13934

traditional cloud storage CPU networking
 

13935
04:07:23,359 --> 04:07:26,189
traditional cloud storage CPU networking
that kind of stuff uh then um in

13936
04:07:26,189 --> 04:07:26,199
that kind of stuff uh then um in
 

13937
04:07:26,199 --> 04:07:28,309
that kind of stuff uh then um in
databases right like you know I think

13938
04:07:28,309 --> 04:07:28,319
databases right like you know I think
 

13939
04:07:28,319 --> 04:07:30,790
databases right like you know I think
like four of Amazon's top five Revenue

13940
04:07:30,790 --> 04:07:30,800
like four of Amazon's top five Revenue
 

13941
04:07:30,800 --> 04:07:32,870
like four of Amazon's top five Revenue
products uh margin products sorry like

13942
04:07:32,870 --> 04:07:32,880
products uh margin products sorry like
 

13943
04:07:32,880 --> 04:07:34,710
products uh margin products sorry like
gross profit products are all database

13944
04:07:34,710 --> 04:07:34,720
gross profit products are all database
 

13945
04:07:34,720 --> 04:07:36,630
gross profit products are all database
related products like red shift and like

all these things right like um so so
 

13949
04:07:39,199 --> 04:07:42,510
all these things right like um so so
Amazon has a very like good silicon 2

user experience like entire Pipeline
 

13953
04:07:44,119 --> 04:07:47,149
user experience like entire Pipeline
with AWS I think Google their INF their

13954
04:07:47,149 --> 04:07:47,159
with AWS I think Google their INF their
 

13955
04:07:47,159 --> 04:07:48,630
with AWS I think Google their INF their
silicon teams yeah they have awesome

um you know some of these other chips
 

13961
04:07:52,760 --> 04:07:55,389
um you know some of these other chips
that they've made and the problem is

13962
04:07:55,389 --> 04:07:55,399
that they've made and the problem is
 

13963
04:07:55,399 --> 04:07:56,750
that they've made and the problem is
they're not serving external customers

13964
04:07:56,750 --> 04:07:56,760
they're not serving external customers
 

13965

they're serving internal customers right
 

13967
04:07:58,319 --> 04:08:00,030
they're serving internal customers right
it's I mean nvidia's entire culture is

13968
04:08:00,030 --> 04:08:00,040
it's I mean nvidia's entire culture is
 

13969
04:08:00,040 --> 04:08:01,630
it's I mean nvidia's entire culture is
designed from the bottom up to do this

04:08:01,630 --> 04:08:01,640
designed from the bottom up to do this
 

13971
04:08:01,640 --> 04:08:03,389
designed from the bottom up to do this
there's this recent book The Nvidia Way

13972
04:08:03,389 --> 04:08:03,399
there's this recent book The Nvidia Way
 

13973
04:08:03,399 --> 04:08:06,149
there's this recent book The Nvidia Way
by takim that details this and they're

13974
04:08:06,149 --> 04:08:06,159
by takim that details this and they're
 

13975
04:08:06,159 --> 04:08:08,389
by takim that details this and they're
how they look for future opportunities

13976
04:08:08,389 --> 04:08:08,399
how they look for future opportunities
 

13977
04:08:08,399 --> 04:08:11,790
how they look for future opportunities
and ready their Cuda software libraries

13978
04:08:11,790 --> 04:08:11,800
and ready their Cuda software libraries
 

13979
04:08:11,800 --> 04:08:14,389
and ready their Cuda software libraries
to make it so that new ations of high

13980
04:08:14,389 --> 04:08:14,399
to make it so that new ations of high

performance Computing can very rapidly

13982
04:08:16,710 --> 04:08:16,720
performance Computing can very rapidly
 

13983
04:08:16,720 --> 04:08:20,469
performance Computing can very rapidly
be evolved on Cuda and Nvidia chips and

13984
04:08:20,469 --> 04:08:20,479
be evolved on Cuda and Nvidia chips and
 

13985
04:08:20,479 --> 04:08:22,309
be evolved on Cuda and Nvidia chips and
that is entirely different than Google

13986
04:08:22,309 --> 04:08:22,319
that is entirely different than Google
 

13987
04:08:22,319 --> 04:08:25,189
that is entirely different than Google
as a Services business yeah I mean

13988
04:08:25,189 --> 04:08:25,199
as a Services business yeah I mean
 

13989
04:08:25,199 --> 04:08:27,429
as a Services business yeah I mean
Nvidia it should be said as a truly

13990
04:08:27,429 --> 04:08:27,439
Nvidia it should be said as a truly
 

13991
04:08:27,439 --> 04:08:29,349
Nvidia it should be said as a truly
special company like I mean they the

13992
04:08:29,349 --> 04:08:29,359
special company like I mean they the
 

13993
04:08:29,359 --> 04:08:31,309
special company like I mean they the
whole the culture of everything they're

13994
04:08:31,309 --> 04:08:31,319
whole the culture of everything they're
 

13995
04:08:31,319 --> 04:08:32,870
whole the culture of everything they're
really optimized for that kind of thing

13996
04:08:32,870 --> 04:08:32,880
really optimized for that kind of thing
 

13997
04:08:32,880 --> 04:08:34,469
really optimized for that kind of thing
speaking of which is there somebody that

13998
04:08:34,469 --> 04:08:34,479
speaking of which is there somebody that
 

13999
04:08:34,479 --> 04:08:37,189
speaking of which is there somebody that
can even challenge Nvidia hardware-wise

14000
04:08:37,189 --> 04:08:37,199
can even challenge Nvidia hardware-wise
 

14001
04:08:37,199 --> 04:08:41,109
can even challenge Nvidia hardware-wise
Intel AMD I I I really don't think so we

14002
04:08:41,109 --> 04:08:41,119
Intel AMD I I I really don't think so we
 

14003
04:08:41,119 --> 04:08:43,750
Intel AMD I I I really don't think so we
went through a like a very long process

14004
04:08:43,750 --> 04:08:43,760
went through a like a very long process
 

14005
04:08:43,760 --> 04:08:46,750
went through a like a very long process
of uh working with AMD on training on

14006
04:08:46,750 --> 04:08:46,760
of uh working with AMD on training on
 

14007
04:08:46,760 --> 04:08:48,750
of uh working with AMD on training on
their gpus infs and stuff and they're

14008
04:08:48,750 --> 04:08:48,760
their gpus infs and stuff and they're
 

14009
04:08:48,760 --> 04:08:50,269
their gpus infs and stuff and they're
they're decent their Hardware is better

14010
04:08:50,269 --> 04:08:50,279
they're decent their Hardware is better
 

14011
04:08:50,279 --> 04:08:52,710
they're decent their Hardware is better
in many ways than in am nvidias uh the

14012
04:08:52,710 --> 04:08:52,720
in many ways than in am nvidias uh the
 

14013
04:08:52,720 --> 04:08:54,269
in many ways than in am nvidias uh the
problem is their software is really bad

14014
04:08:54,269 --> 04:08:54,279
problem is their software is really bad
 

14015
04:08:54,279 --> 04:08:55,710
problem is their software is really bad
and I think they're they're getting

14016
04:08:55,710 --> 04:08:55,720
and I think they're they're getting
 

14017
04:08:55,720 --> 04:08:56,750
and I think they're they're getting
better right they're getting better

14018
04:08:56,750 --> 04:08:56,760
better right they're getting better
 

14019
04:08:56,760 --> 04:08:58,389
better right they're getting better
faster but they're just the gulf is so

14020
04:08:58,389 --> 04:08:58,399
faster but they're just the gulf is so
 

14021
04:08:58,399 --> 04:09:01,550
faster but they're just the gulf is so
large um and like they don't spend

14022
04:09:01,550 --> 04:09:01,560
large um and like they don't spend
 

14023
04:09:01,560 --> 04:09:02,870
large um and like they don't spend
enough resources on it or haven't

14024
04:09:02,870 --> 04:09:02,880
enough resources on it or haven't
 

14025
04:09:02,880 --> 04:09:04,030
enough resources on it or haven't
historically right maybe they're

14026
04:09:04,030 --> 04:09:04,040
historically right maybe they're
 

14027
04:09:04,040 --> 04:09:06,389
historically right maybe they're
changing their tune now but you know for

14028
04:09:06,389 --> 04:09:06,399
changing their tune now but you know for
 

14029
04:09:06,399 --> 04:09:07,910
changing their tune now but you know for
for for multiple months we were

14030
04:09:07,910 --> 04:09:07,920
for for multiple months we were
 

14031
04:09:07,920 --> 04:09:10,030
for for multiple months we were
submitting the most bugs right like us

14032
04:09:10,030 --> 04:09:10,040
submitting the most bugs right like us
 

14033
04:09:10,040 --> 04:09:11,830
submitting the most bugs right like us
semi analysis right like what the

14034
04:09:11,830 --> 04:09:11,840
semi analysis right like what the
 

14035
04:09:11,840 --> 04:09:13,870
semi analysis right like what the
like why are we submitting the most bugs

14036
04:09:13,870 --> 04:09:13,880
like why are we submitting the most bugs
 

14037
04:09:13,880 --> 04:09:15,510
like why are we submitting the most bugs
right cuz they only and they they only

14038
04:09:15,510 --> 04:09:15,520
right cuz they only and they they only
 

14039
04:09:15,520 --> 04:09:17,309
right cuz they only and they they only
cared about their like biggest customers

14040
04:09:17,309 --> 04:09:17,319
cared about their like biggest customers
 

14041
04:09:17,319 --> 04:09:18,870
cared about their like biggest customers
and so they'd Shi them a private image

14042
04:09:18,870 --> 04:09:18,880
and so they'd Shi them a private image
 

14043
04:09:18,880 --> 04:09:20,309
and so they'd Shi them a private image
blah blah blah and it's like okay but

14044
04:09:20,309 --> 04:09:20,319
blah blah blah and it's like okay but
 

14045
04:09:20,319 --> 04:09:23,309
blah blah blah and it's like okay but
like I am just using pie torch and I

14046
04:09:23,309 --> 04:09:23,319
like I am just using pie torch and I
 

14047
04:09:23,319 --> 04:09:24,590
like I am just using pie torch and I
want to use the publicly available

14048
04:09:24,590 --> 04:09:24,600
want to use the publicly available
 

14049
04:09:24,600 --> 04:09:26,309
want to use the publicly available
libraries and like you don't care about

14050
04:09:26,309 --> 04:09:26,319
libraries and like you don't care about
 

14051
04:09:26,319 --> 04:09:27,630
libraries and like you don't care about
that right so they're they're getting

14052
04:09:27,630 --> 04:09:27,640
that right so they're they're getting
 

14053
04:09:27,640 --> 04:09:29,950
that right so they're they're getting
better um but like I think AMD is not

14054
04:09:29,950 --> 04:09:29,960
better um but like I think AMD is not
 

14055
04:09:29,960 --> 04:09:31,389
better um but like I think AMD is not
possible Intel is obviously in Dire

14056
04:09:31,389 --> 04:09:31,399
possible Intel is obviously in Dire
 

14057
04:09:31,399 --> 04:09:33,429
possible Intel is obviously in Dire
Straits right now um and needs to be

14058
04:09:33,429 --> 04:09:33,439
Straits right now um and needs to be
 

14059
04:09:33,439 --> 04:09:35,630

saved somehow uh very important for

14060
04:09:35,630 --> 04:09:35,640
saved somehow uh very important for
 

14061
04:09:35,640 --> 04:09:39,070
saved somehow uh very important for
National Security for American you can

14062
04:09:39,070 --> 04:09:39,080
National Security for American you can
 

14063
04:09:39,080 --> 04:09:40,790
National Security for American you can
you explain the obviously so why why are

14064
04:09:40,790 --> 04:09:40,800
you explain the obviously so why why are
 

14065
04:09:40,800 --> 04:09:42,750
you explain the obviously so why why are
they in D Straits going back to earlier

14066
04:09:42,750 --> 04:09:42,760
they in D Straits going back to earlier
 

14067
04:09:42,760 --> 04:09:44,109
they in D Straits going back to earlier
only three

14068
04:09:44,109 --> 04:09:44,119
only three
 

14069
04:09:44,119 --> 04:09:48,429
only three
can R&D right Taiwan sinu Samsung uh

14070
04:09:48,429 --> 04:09:48,439
can R&D right Taiwan sinu Samsung uh
 

14071
04:09:48,439 --> 04:09:50,910

Samsung's doing horribly Intel's doing
horribly we could be in a world where

14076
04:09:54,149 --> 04:09:54,159
horribly we could be in a world where
 

14077
04:09:54,159 --> 04:09:55,950
horribly we could be in a world where
there's only one company that can do R&D

14078

there's only one company that can do R&D
and that one company already

14080
04:09:56,830 --> 04:09:56,840
and that one company already
 

14081
04:09:56,840 --> 04:09:58,070
and that one company already
manufactures most of chips they've been

14082
04:09:58,070 --> 04:09:58,080
manufactures most of chips they've been
 

14083
04:09:58,080 --> 04:09:59,950
manufactures most of chips they've been
gaining market share anyways but like

14084
04:09:59,950 --> 04:09:59,960
gaining market share anyways but like
 

14085
04:09:59,960 --> 04:10:01,590
gaining market share anyways but like
that's that's a critical thing right so

14086
04:10:01,590 --> 04:10:01,600
that's that's a critical thing right so
 

14087
04:10:01,600 --> 04:10:03,149
that's that's a critical thing right so
what happens to Taiwan means the rest of

14088
04:10:03,149 --> 04:10:03,159
what happens to Taiwan means the rest of
 

14089
04:10:03,159 --> 04:10:04,309
what happens to Taiwan means the rest of
the world's semiconductor industry and

14090
04:10:04,309 --> 04:10:04,319
the world's semiconductor industry and
 

14091
04:10:04,319 --> 04:10:07,229
the world's semiconductor industry and
therefore Tech relies on Taiwan right um

14092
04:10:07,229 --> 04:10:07,239
therefore Tech relies on Taiwan right um
 

14093
04:10:07,239 --> 04:10:09,349
therefore Tech relies on Taiwan right um
and that's obviously precarious um as

14094
04:10:09,349 --> 04:10:09,359
and that's obviously precarious um as
 

14095
04:10:09,359 --> 04:10:11,590
and that's obviously precarious um as
far as like Intel they've been slowly

14096
04:10:11,590 --> 04:10:11,600
far as like Intel they've been slowly
 

14097
04:10:11,600 --> 04:10:14,229
far as like Intel they've been slowly
steadily declining they they were on top

14098
04:10:14,229 --> 04:10:14,239
steadily declining they they were on top
 

14099
04:10:14,239 --> 04:10:17,070
steadily declining they they were on top
of servers and PCs but now Apple's done

14100
04:10:17,070 --> 04:10:17,080
of servers and PCs but now Apple's done
 

14101
04:10:17,080 --> 04:10:19,389
of servers and PCs but now Apple's done
the M1 and nvidia's releasing a PC chip

14102
04:10:19,389 --> 04:10:19,399
the M1 and nvidia's releasing a PC chip
 

14103
04:10:19,399 --> 04:10:21,109
the M1 and nvidia's releasing a PC chip
and qualcomm's releasing a PC chip and

14104
04:10:21,109 --> 04:10:21,119
and qualcomm's releasing a PC chip and
 

14105
04:10:21,119 --> 04:10:23,189
and qualcomm's releasing a PC chip and
in servers hyperscalers are all making

14106
04:10:23,189 --> 04:10:23,199
in servers hyperscalers are all making
 

14107
04:10:23,199 --> 04:10:25,910
in servers hyperscalers are all making
their own Arm based uh server chips and

14108
04:10:25,910 --> 04:10:25,920
their own Arm based uh server chips and
 

14109
04:10:25,920 --> 04:10:28,910
their own Arm based uh server chips and
Intel has no AI silicon uh like winds

14110
04:10:28,910 --> 04:10:28,920
Intel has no AI silicon uh like winds
 

14111
04:10:28,920 --> 04:10:31,469
Intel has no AI silicon uh like winds
right they have very small wins um and

14112
04:10:31,469 --> 04:10:31,479
right they have very small wins um and
 

14113
04:10:31,479 --> 04:10:32,910
right they have very small wins um and
and they never got into Mobile because

14114
04:10:32,910 --> 04:10:32,920
and they never got into Mobile because
 

14115
04:10:32,920 --> 04:10:34,710
and they never got into Mobile because
they said no to the iPhone and like all

14116
04:10:34,710 --> 04:10:34,720
they said no to the iPhone and like all
 

14117
04:10:34,720 --> 04:10:35,950
they said no to the iPhone and like all
these things have compounded and they've

14118
04:10:35,950 --> 04:10:35,960
these things have compounded and they've
 

14119
04:10:35,960 --> 04:10:37,630
these things have compounded and they've
lost their process technology leadership

14120
04:10:37,630 --> 04:10:37,640
lost their process technology leadership
 

14121
04:10:37,640 --> 04:10:38,870
lost their process technology leadership
right they were ahead for 20 years and

14122
04:10:38,870 --> 04:10:38,880
right they were ahead for 20 years and
 

14123
04:10:38,880 --> 04:10:40,670
right they were ahead for 20 years and
now they're behind by at least couple

14124
04:10:40,670 --> 04:10:40,680
now they're behind by at least couple
 

14125
04:10:40,680 --> 04:10:42,149
now they're behind by at least couple
years right and they're trying to catch

14126
04:10:42,149 --> 04:10:42,159
years right and they're trying to catch
 

14127
04:10:42,159 --> 04:10:45,070
years right and they're trying to catch
back up and we'll see if their 18a 14a

14128
04:10:45,070 --> 04:10:45,080
back up and we'll see if their 18a 14a
 

14129
04:10:45,080 --> 04:10:46,510
back up and we'll see if their 18a 14a
strategy works out where they try and

14130
04:10:46,510 --> 04:10:46,520
strategy works out where they try and
 

14131
04:10:46,520 --> 04:10:49,870

right and they just fired their CEO even

14136
04:10:53,109 --> 04:10:53,119
right and they just fired their CEO even
 

14137
04:10:53,119 --> 04:10:54,990
right and they just fired their CEO even
though the CEO was the only person who

14138

understood the company well right we'll
 

14141
04:10:56,640 --> 04:10:58,750
understood the company well right we'll
see he was not the best but he was

14142
04:10:58,750 --> 04:10:58,760
see he was not the best but he was
 

14143
04:10:58,760 --> 04:11:01,590
see he was not the best but he was
pretty good relatively technical guy

on AI right now is anyone making money

14192
04:11:55,030 --> 04:11:55,040
on AI right now is anyone making money
 

14193
04:11:55,040 --> 04:11:57,149
on AI right now is anyone making money
so accounting profit wise Microsoft is

14194
04:11:57,149 --> 04:11:57,159
so accounting profit wise Microsoft is
 

14195
04:11:57,159 --> 04:11:58,750
so accounting profit wise Microsoft is
making money but they're spending a lot

14196
04:11:58,750 --> 04:11:58,760
making money but they're spending a lot
 

14197
04:11:58,760 --> 04:12:00,389
making money but they're spending a lot
of cap backs right you know and that's

14198
04:12:00,389 --> 04:12:00,399
of cap backs right you know and that's
 

14199
04:12:00,399 --> 04:12:02,630

gets depreciated over years uh meta is
 

14201
04:12:02,640 --> 04:12:04,189
gets depreciated over years uh meta is
making tons of money but with

14202
04:12:04,189 --> 04:12:04,199
making tons of money but with
 

14203
04:12:04,199 --> 04:12:06,429
making tons of money but with
recommendation systems which is AI but

14204
04:12:06,429 --> 04:12:06,439
recommendation systems which is AI but
 

14205
04:12:06,439 --> 04:12:07,830
recommendation systems which is AI but
not with llama right llama's losing

14206
04:12:07,830 --> 04:12:07,840
not with llama right llama's losing
 

14207
04:12:07,840 --> 04:12:10,750
not with llama right llama's losing
money for sure right um I think

14208
04:12:10,750 --> 04:12:10,760
money for sure right um I think
 

14209
04:12:10,760 --> 04:12:12,429
money for sure right um I think
anthropic and open eye are obviously not

14210
04:12:12,429 --> 04:12:12,439
anthropic and open eye are obviously not
 

14211
04:12:12,439 --> 04:12:13,830
anthropic and open eye are obviously not
making money cuz otherwise they wouldn't

14212
04:12:13,830 --> 04:12:13,840
making money cuz otherwise they wouldn't
 

14213
04:12:13,840 --> 04:12:15,550
making money cuz otherwise they wouldn't
be raising money right they have to

14214
04:12:15,550 --> 04:12:15,560
be raising money right they have to
 

14215
04:12:15,560 --> 04:12:17,790
be raising money right they have to
raise money to build more right um

14216
04:12:17,790 --> 04:12:17,800
raise money to build more right um
 

14217
04:12:17,800 --> 04:12:19,349
raise money to build more right um
although theoretically they are making

14218
04:12:19,349 --> 04:12:19,359
although theoretically they are making
 

14219
04:12:19,359 --> 04:12:20,990
although theoretically they are making
money right like you know you spent few

14220
04:12:20,990 --> 04:12:21,000
money right like you know you spent few
 

14221
04:12:21,000 --> 04:12:23,429
money right like you know you spent few
hundred million do on gp4 and it's doing

14222
04:12:23,429 --> 04:12:23,439
hundred million do on gp4 and it's doing
 

14223
04:12:23,439 --> 04:12:25,030
hundred million do on gp4 and it's doing
billions in Revenue so like obviously

14224
04:12:25,030 --> 04:12:25,040
billions in Revenue so like obviously
 

14225
04:12:25,040 --> 04:12:26,590
billions in Revenue so like obviously
it's like making money although they had

14226
04:12:26,590 --> 04:12:26,600
it's like making money although they had
 

14227
04:12:26,600 --> 04:12:27,950
it's like making money although they had
to continue to research to get the

14228
04:12:27,950 --> 04:12:27,960
to continue to research to get the
 

14229
04:12:27,960 --> 04:12:29,790
to continue to research to get the
compute efficiency wins right and and

14230
04:12:29,790 --> 04:12:29,800
compute efficiency wins right and and
 

14231
04:12:29,800 --> 04:12:31,990
compute efficiency wins right and and
move down the curve uh to like you know

14232
04:12:31,990 --> 04:12:32,000
move down the curve uh to like you know
 

14233
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:33,670
move down the curve uh to like you know
that 12 get that 1200X that has been

14234
04:12:33,670 --> 04:12:33,680
that 12 get that 1200X that has been
 

14235
04:12:33,680 --> 04:12:36,269
that 12 get that 1200X that has been
achieved for gpt3 you know maybe we're

14236
04:12:36,269 --> 04:12:36,279
achieved for gpt3 you know maybe we're
 

14237
04:12:36,279 --> 04:12:37,750
achieved for gpt3 you know maybe we're
only at like uh you know a couple

14238
04:12:37,750 --> 04:12:37,760
only at like uh you know a couple
 

14239
04:12:37,760 --> 04:12:39,670
only at like uh you know a couple
hundred X now but you know with gp4

14240
04:12:39,670 --> 04:12:39,680
hundred X now but you know with gp4
 

14241
04:12:39,680 --> 04:12:41,229
hundred X now but you know with gp4
turbo and 40 and there will be another

14242
04:12:41,229 --> 04:12:41,239
turbo and 40 and there will be another
 

14243
04:12:41,239 --> 04:12:44,149
turbo and 40 and there will be another
one probably cheaper than GP 40 even

14244
04:12:44,149 --> 04:12:44,159
one probably cheaper than GP 40 even
 

14245
04:12:44,159 --> 04:12:45,870
one probably cheaper than GP 40 even
that comes out at some point and that

14246
04:12:45,870 --> 04:12:45,880
that comes out at some point and that
 

14247
04:12:45,880 --> 04:12:48,630
that comes out at some point and that
research cost a a lot of money yep

14248
04:12:48,630 --> 04:12:48,640
research cost a a lot of money yep
 

14249
04:12:48,640 --> 04:12:50,109
research cost a a lot of money yep
exactly that's the thing that I guess is

14250
04:12:50,109 --> 04:12:50,119
exactly that's the thing that I guess is
 

14251
04:12:50,119 --> 04:12:53,269
exactly that's the thing that I guess is
not talked about with the cost the that

14252
04:12:53,269 --> 04:12:53,279
not talked about with the cost the that
 

14253
04:12:53,279 --> 04:12:54,870
not talked about with the cost the that
uh when you're referring to the cost of

14254
04:12:54,870 --> 04:12:54,880
uh when you're referring to the cost of
 

14255
04:12:54,880 --> 04:12:57,950
uh when you're referring to the cost of
the model it's not just the training or

14256
04:12:57,950 --> 04:12:57,960
the model it's not just the training or
 

14257
04:12:57,960 --> 04:13:00,590
the model it's not just the training or
the test runs it's the actual research

14258
04:13:00,590 --> 04:13:00,600
the test runs it's the actual research
 

14259
04:13:00,600 --> 04:13:02,550
the test runs it's the actual research
the the Manpower that yeah to do things

14260
04:13:02,550 --> 04:13:02,560
the the Manpower that yeah to do things
 

14261
04:13:02,560 --> 04:13:03,750
the the Manpower that yeah to do things
like reasoning right now that that

14262
04:13:03,750 --> 04:13:03,760
like reasoning right now that that
 

14263
04:13:03,760 --> 04:13:04,790
like reasoning right now that that
exists they're going to scale it they're

14264
04:13:04,790 --> 04:13:04,800
exists they're going to scale it they're
 

14265
04:13:04,800 --> 04:13:06,070
exists they're going to scale it they're
going to do a lot of research still I

14266
04:13:06,070 --> 04:13:06,080
going to do a lot of research still I
 

14267
04:13:06,080 --> 04:13:08,910
going to do a lot of research still I
think I think the you know people focus

14268
04:13:08,910 --> 04:13:08,920
think I think the you know people focus
 

14269
04:13:08,920 --> 04:13:10,469
think I think the you know people focus
on the payback question but it's really

14270
04:13:10,469 --> 04:13:10,479
on the payback question but it's really
 

14271
04:13:10,479 --> 04:13:12,550
on the payback question but it's really
easy to like just be like well like you

14272
04:13:12,550 --> 04:13:12,560
easy to like just be like well like you
 

14273
04:13:12,560 --> 04:13:15,189
easy to like just be like well like you
know GDP is humans and Industrial

14274
04:13:15,189 --> 04:13:15,199
know GDP is humans and Industrial
 

14275
04:13:15,199 --> 04:13:16,630
know GDP is humans and Industrial
Capital right and if you can make

14276
04:13:16,630 --> 04:13:16,640
Capital right and if you can make
 

14277
04:13:16,640 --> 04:13:19,189
Capital right and if you can make
intelligence cheap then you can grow a

14278
04:13:19,189 --> 04:13:19,199
intelligence cheap then you can grow a
 

14279
04:13:19,199 --> 04:13:21,349
intelligence cheap then you can grow a
lot right that's the sort of dumb dumb

14280
04:13:21,349 --> 04:13:21,359
lot right that's the sort of dumb dumb
 

14281
04:13:21,359 --> 04:13:22,550
lot right that's the sort of dumb dumb
way to explain it but that's sort of

14282
04:13:22,550 --> 04:13:22,560
way to explain it but that's sort of
 

14283
04:13:22,560 --> 04:13:25,229
way to explain it but that's sort of
what basically the investment thesis is

14284
04:13:25,229 --> 04:13:25,239
what basically the investment thesis is
 

14285
04:13:25,239 --> 04:13:26,870
what basically the investment thesis is
um I think only Nvidia is actually

14286
04:13:26,870 --> 04:13:26,880
um I think only Nvidia is actually
 

14287
04:13:26,880 --> 04:13:28,670
um I think only Nvidia is actually

um because the Investments the the

14324
04:14:04,510 --> 04:14:04,520
um because the Investments the the
 

14325
04:14:04,520 --> 04:14:05,469
um because the Investments the the

returns from it are going to be
 

14327
04:14:05,479 --> 04:14:08,189
returns from it are going to be
eventually huge once we have AGI so do

04:14:08,189 --> 04:14:08,199
eventually huge once we have AGI so do

let's I don't think it's win or take all
 

14333
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:15,469
let's I don't think it's win or take all
okay so it's not uh let's not call it

it's a gradual thingi super powerful AI

14338
04:14:20,590 --> 04:14:20,600
it's a gradual thingi super powerful AI
 

14339
04:14:20,600 --> 04:14:23,030
it's a gradual thingi super powerful AI
but it's it's a gradually increasing set

14340
04:14:23,030 --> 04:14:23,040
but it's it's a gradually increasing set
 

14341
04:14:23,040 --> 04:14:25,790
but it's it's a gradually increasing set
of features that are useful and uh make

14342
04:14:25,790 --> 04:14:25,800
of features that are useful and uh make
 

14343
04:14:25,800 --> 04:14:28,189
of features that are useful and uh make
rapidly increasing set rapidly

14344
04:14:28,189 --> 04:14:28,199
rapidly increasing set rapidly
 

14345
04:14:28,199 --> 04:14:30,830
rapidly increasing set rapidly
increasing set of features uh so you're

14346
04:14:30,830 --> 04:14:30,840
increasing set of features uh so you're
 

14347
04:14:30,840 --> 04:14:33,550
increasing set of features uh so you're
saying a lot of companies will be it

14348
04:14:33,550 --> 04:14:33,560
saying a lot of companies will be it
 

14349
04:14:33,560 --> 04:14:34,870
saying a lot of companies will be it
just seems

14350
04:14:34,870 --> 04:14:34,880
just seems
 

14351
04:14:34,880 --> 04:14:38,670
just seems
absurd that all of these companies are

14352
04:14:38,670 --> 04:14:38,680
absurd that all of these companies are
 

14353
04:14:38,680 --> 04:14:41,070
absurd that all of these companies are
building gigantic data centers there are

14354
04:14:41,070 --> 04:14:41,080
building gigantic data centers there are
 

14355
04:14:41,080 --> 04:14:43,070
building gigantic data centers there are
companies that will benefit from AI but

14356
04:14:43,070 --> 04:14:43,080
companies that will benefit from AI but
 

14357
04:14:43,080 --> 04:14:44,830
companies that will benefit from AI but
not because they train the best model

14358
04:14:44,830 --> 04:14:44,840
not because they train the best model
 

14359
04:14:44,840 --> 04:14:46,990
not because they train the best model
like meta has so many Avenues to benefit

14360
04:14:46,990 --> 04:14:47,000
like meta has so many Avenues to benefit
 

14361
04:14:47,000 --> 04:14:48,870
like meta has so many Avenues to benefit
from Ai and all of their services people

14362
04:14:48,870 --> 04:14:48,880
from Ai and all of their services people
 

14363
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:51,070
from Ai and all of their services people
are there people spend time on meta

14364
04:14:51,070 --> 04:14:51,080
are there people spend time on meta
 

14365
04:14:51,080 --> 04:14:52,630
are there people spend time on meta
platforms and it's a way to make more

14366
04:14:52,630 --> 04:14:52,640
platforms and it's a way to make more
 

14367
04:14:52,640 --> 04:14:54,950
platforms and it's a way to make more
money per user per hour yeah it seems

14368
04:14:54,950 --> 04:14:54,960
money per user per hour yeah it seems
 

14369
04:14:54,960 --> 04:14:56,309
money per user per hour yeah it seems
like

14370
04:14:56,309 --> 04:14:56,319
like

intelligence like the additional boost
of intelligence to the products they

14382
04:15:12,429 --> 04:15:12,439
of intelligence to the products they
 

14383
04:15:12,439 --> 04:15:13,830
of intelligence to the products they
already sell so whether that's the

14384
04:15:13,830 --> 04:15:13,840
already sell so whether that's the
 

14385
04:15:13,840 --> 04:15:16,469
already sell so whether that's the
recommendation system or for Elon who's

14386
04:15:16,469 --> 04:15:16,479
recommendation system or for Elon who's
 

14387
04:15:16,479 --> 04:15:19,269
recommendation system or for Elon who's
been talking about Optimus the robot

14388
04:15:19,269 --> 04:15:19,279
been talking about Optimus the robot
 

14389
04:15:19,279 --> 04:15:21,389
been talking about Optimus the robot
potentially the intelligence of the

14390
04:15:21,389 --> 04:15:21,399
potentially the intelligence of the
 

14391
04:15:21,399 --> 04:15:23,830
potentially the intelligence of the
robot and then you have personalized

14392
04:15:23,830 --> 04:15:23,840
robot and then you have personalized
 

14393
04:15:23,840 --> 04:15:25,790
robot and then you have personalized
robots in the home that kind of thing he

14394
04:15:25,790 --> 04:15:25,800
robots in the home that kind of thing he
 

14395
04:15:25,800 --> 04:15:29,550
robots in the home that kind of thing he
thinks it's a 10 10 plus trillion dollar

14396
04:15:29,550 --> 04:15:29,560
thinks it's a 10 10 plus trillion dollar
 

14397
04:15:29,560 --> 04:15:31,469
thinks it's a 10 10 plus trillion dollar
business

14398
04:15:31,469 --> 04:15:31,479
business
 

14399
04:15:31,479 --> 04:15:33,990
business
which at some point maybe I don't not

14400
04:15:33,990 --> 04:15:34,000
which at some point maybe I don't not
 

14401
04:15:34,000 --> 04:15:36,229
which at some point maybe I don't not
soon but who knows what robotic Let's do

14402
04:15:36,229 --> 04:15:36,239
soon but who knows what robotic Let's do
 

14403
04:15:36,239 --> 04:15:38,189
soon but who knows what robotic Let's do
let's do a tam analysis right 8 billion

14404
04:15:38,189 --> 04:15:38,199
let's do a tam analysis right 8 billion
 

14405
04:15:38,199 --> 04:15:41,070
let's do a tam analysis right 8 billion
humans and let's get 8 billion robots

14406
04:15:41,070 --> 04:15:41,080
humans and let's get 8 billion robots
 

14407
04:15:41,080 --> 04:15:42,469
humans and let's get 8 billion robots
right and let's let's pay them the

14408
04:15:42,469 --> 04:15:42,479
right and let's let's pay them the
 

14409
04:15:42,479 --> 04:15:44,149
right and let's let's pay them the
average Sal and yeah there we go 10

14410
04:15:44,149 --> 04:15:44,159
average Sal and yeah there we go 10
 

14411
04:15:44,159 --> 04:15:46,830
average Sal and yeah there we go 10
trillion more than 10 trillion yeah I

14412
04:15:46,830 --> 04:15:46,840
trillion more than 10 trillion yeah I
 

14413
04:15:46,840 --> 04:15:48,950
trillion more than 10 trillion yeah I
mean you know if if if there's robots

14414
04:15:48,950 --> 04:15:48,960
mean you know if if if there's robots
 

14415
04:15:48,960 --> 04:15:51,070
mean you know if if if there's robots
everywhere why does it have to be just

14416
04:15:51,070 --> 04:15:51,080
everywhere why does it have to be just
 

14417
04:15:51,080 --> 04:15:52,910
everywhere why does it have to be just
eight eight eight billion robots yeah

14418
04:15:52,910 --> 04:15:52,920
eight eight eight billion robots yeah
 

14419
04:15:52,920 --> 04:15:54,630
eight eight eight billion robots yeah
yeah of course of course I'm gonna get

14420
04:15:54,630 --> 04:15:54,640
yeah of course of course I'm gonna get
 

14421
04:15:54,640 --> 04:15:56,149
yeah of course of course I'm gonna get
I'm gonna have like one robot you're

14422
04:15:56,149 --> 04:15:56,159
I'm gonna have like one robot you're
 

14423
04:15:56,159 --> 04:15:58,710
I'm gonna have like one robot you're
gonna have like 20 yeah I mean I see

14424
04:15:58,710 --> 04:15:58,720
gonna have like 20 yeah I mean I see
 

14425
04:15:58,720 --> 04:16:01,269
gonna have like 20 yeah I mean I see
used case for that so yeah so I guess

14426
04:16:01,269 --> 04:16:01,279
used case for that so yeah so I guess
 

14427
04:16:01,279 --> 04:16:02,830
used case for that so yeah so I guess
the benefit would be in the products

14428
04:16:02,830 --> 04:16:02,840
the benefit would be in the products
 

14429
04:16:02,840 --> 04:16:05,070
the benefit would be in the products
sell which is why opening ey is in a

14430
04:16:05,070 --> 04:16:05,080
sell which is why opening ey is in a
 

14431
04:16:05,080 --> 04:16:06,710
sell which is why opening ey is in a
trickier position because they all of

14432
04:16:06,710 --> 04:16:06,720
trickier position because they all of
 

14433
04:16:06,720 --> 04:16:08,510
trickier position because they all of
the value of open AI right now as a

14434
04:16:08,510 --> 04:16:08,520
the value of open AI right now as a
 

14435
04:16:08,520 --> 04:16:11,070
the value of open AI right now as a
brand is in Chachi PT and there is

14436
04:16:11,070 --> 04:16:11,080
brand is in Chachi PT and there is
 

14437
04:16:11,080 --> 04:16:13,510
brand is in Chachi PT and there is
actually not that for most users there's

14438
04:16:13,510 --> 04:16:13,520
actually not that for most users there's
 

14439
04:16:13,520 --> 04:16:15,269
actually not that for most users there's
not that much of a reason that they need

14440
04:16:15,269 --> 04:16:15,279
not that much of a reason that they need
 

14441
04:16:15,279 --> 04:16:17,070
not that much of a reason that they need
open AI to be spending billions and

14442
04:16:17,070 --> 04:16:17,080
open AI to be spending billions and
 

14443
04:16:17,080 --> 04:16:18,630
open AI to be spending billions and
billions of dollars on the next best

14444
04:16:18,630 --> 04:16:18,640
billions of dollars on the next best
 

14445
04:16:18,640 --> 04:16:20,990
billions of dollars on the next best
model when they could just license llama

14446
04:16:20,990 --> 04:16:21,000
model when they could just license llama
 

14447
04:16:21,000 --> 04:16:23,429
model when they could just license llama
five and for be way cheaper so that's

14448
04:16:23,429 --> 04:16:23,439
five and for be way cheaper so that's
 

14449
04:16:23,439 --> 04:16:26,389
five and for be way cheaper so that's
kind of like chat gbt is an extremely

14450
04:16:26,389 --> 04:16:26,399
kind of like chat gbt is an extremely
 

14451
04:16:26,399 --> 04:16:28,149
kind of like chat gbt is an extremely
valuable entity to

14452
04:16:28,149 --> 04:16:28,159
valuable entity to
 

14453
04:16:28,159 --> 04:16:30,670
valuable entity to
them but like they could make more money

14454
04:16:30,670 --> 04:16:30,680
them but like they could make more money
 

14455
04:16:30,680 --> 04:16:32,309
them but like they could make more money
just off that than the chat application

14456
04:16:32,309 --> 04:16:32,319
just off that than the chat application
 

14457
04:16:32,319 --> 04:16:34,269
just off that than the chat application
is clearly like does not have tons of

14458
04:16:34,269 --> 04:16:34,279
is clearly like does not have tons of
 

14459
04:16:34,279 --> 04:16:35,950
is clearly like does not have tons of
room to continue right like the standard

14460
04:16:35,950 --> 04:16:35,960
room to continue right like the standard
 

14461
04:16:35,960 --> 04:16:37,189
room to continue right like the standard
chat right where you're just using it

14462
04:16:37,189 --> 04:16:37,199
chat right where you're just using it
 

14463
04:16:37,199 --> 04:16:39,229
chat right where you're just using it
for random questions and stuff right the

14464
04:16:39,229 --> 04:16:39,239
for random questions and stuff right the
 

14465
04:16:39,239 --> 04:16:41,149
for random questions and stuff right the
cost continues to collapse V3 is the

14466
04:16:41,149 --> 04:16:41,159
cost continues to collapse V3 is the
 

14467
04:16:41,159 --> 04:16:43,910
cost continues to collapse V3 is the
latest biggest uh but it's going to get

14468
04:16:43,910 --> 04:16:43,920
latest biggest uh but it's going to get
 

14469
04:16:43,920 --> 04:16:46,429
latest biggest uh but it's going to get
supported by ads right like as you know

14470
04:16:46,429 --> 04:16:46,439
supported by ads right like as you know
 

14471
04:16:46,439 --> 04:16:48,269
supported by ads right like as you know
llama meta already serves 405b and

14472
04:16:48,269 --> 04:16:48,279
llama meta already serves 405b and
 

14473
04:16:48,279 --> 04:16:49,670
llama meta already serves 405b and
probably loses the money but at some

14474
04:16:49,670 --> 04:16:49,680
probably loses the money but at some
 

14475
04:16:49,680 --> 04:16:51,990
probably loses the money but at some
point you know they're going to get uh

14476
04:16:51,990 --> 04:16:52,000
point you know they're going to get uh
 

14477
04:16:52,000 --> 04:16:53,309
point you know they're going to get uh
the models are going to get so cheap

14478
04:16:53,309 --> 04:16:53,319
the models are going to get so cheap
 

14479
04:16:53,319 --> 04:16:55,189
the models are going to get so cheap
that they can just serve them for free

14480
04:16:55,189 --> 04:16:55,199
that they can just serve them for free
 

14481
04:16:55,199 --> 04:16:56,510
that they can just serve them for free
with ads supported right and that's what

14482
04:16:56,510 --> 04:16:56,520
with ads supported right and that's what
 

14483
04:16:56,520 --> 04:16:57,950
with ads supported right and that's what
Google's going to be able to do and

14484
04:16:57,950 --> 04:16:57,960
Google's going to be able to do and
 

14485
04:16:57,960 --> 04:16:58,990
Google's going to be able to do and
that's obviously they've got a bigger

14486
04:16:58,990 --> 04:16:59,000
that's obviously they've got a bigger
 

14487

14489
04:17:00,760 --> 04:17:02,389
reach right so chat is not going to be
the only use case it's like these

14490
04:17:02,389 --> 04:17:02,399
the only use case it's like these
 

14491
04:17:02,399 --> 04:17:05,870
the only use case it's like these
reasoning code agents computer use all

14492
04:17:05,870 --> 04:17:05,880
reasoning code agents computer use all
 

14493
04:17:05,880 --> 04:17:07,469
reasoning code agents computer use all
this stuff is where opena has to

14494
04:17:07,469 --> 04:17:07,479
this stuff is where opena has to
 

14495
04:17:07,479 --> 04:17:09,030
this stuff is where opena has to
actually go to make money in the future

14496
04:17:09,030 --> 04:17:09,040
actually go to make money in the future
 

14497
04:17:09,040 --> 04:17:13,309
actually go to make money in the future
otherwise they're kaputs but X Google

14498
04:17:13,309 --> 04:17:13,319
otherwise they're kaputs but X Google
 

14499
04:17:13,319 --> 04:17:15,830
otherwise they're kaputs but X Google
and meta have these other products so

14500
04:17:15,830 --> 04:17:15,840
and meta have these other products so
 

14501
04:17:15,840 --> 04:17:19,469
and meta have these other products so
doesn't isn't it likely that open Ai and

14502
04:17:19,469 --> 04:17:19,479
doesn't isn't it likely that open Ai and
 

14503
04:17:19,479 --> 04:17:22,550
doesn't isn't it likely that open Ai and
anthropic disappear eventually unless

14504
04:17:22,550 --> 04:17:22,560
anthropic disappear eventually unless
 

14505
04:17:22,560 --> 04:17:24,510
anthropic disappear eventually unless
they're so good at models they are but

14506
04:17:24,510 --> 04:17:24,520
they're so good at models they are but
 

14507
04:17:24,520 --> 04:17:26,630
they're so good at models they are but
it's such a cutting I mean it depends on

14508
04:17:26,630 --> 04:17:26,640
it's such a cutting I mean it depends on
 

14509
04:17:26,640 --> 04:17:28,229
it's such a cutting I mean it depends on
where you think AI capabilities are

14510
04:17:28,229 --> 04:17:28,239
where you think AI capabilities are
 

14511
04:17:28,239 --> 04:17:30,550
where you think AI capabilities are
going you have to keep winning yes you

14512
04:17:30,550 --> 04:17:30,560
going you have to keep winning yes you
 

14513
04:17:30,560 --> 04:17:33,030
going you have to keep winning yes you
have to keep winning this as you climb

14514
04:17:33,030 --> 04:17:33,040
have to keep winning this as you climb
 

14515
04:17:33,040 --> 04:17:35,229
have to keep winning this as you climb
is even if they capabilities are going

14516
04:17:35,229 --> 04:17:35,239
is even if they capabilities are going
 

14517
04:17:35,239 --> 04:17:37,269
is even if they capabilities are going
super rapidly awesome into the direction

14518
04:17:37,269 --> 04:17:37,279
super rapidly awesome into the direction
 

14519
04:17:37,279 --> 04:17:42,229
super rapidly awesome into the direction
of AI like there's still a boost for X

14520
04:17:42,229 --> 04:17:42,239
of AI like there's still a boost for X
 

14521
04:17:42,239 --> 04:17:44,710
of AI like there's still a boost for X

products and the money and like there's
 

14527
04:17:49,040 --> 04:17:50,910

just huge amount money the whole idea is

so shade it wouldn't come off Shady so
 

14683
04:20:40,040 --> 04:20:41,790
so shade it wouldn't come off Shady so
you would receive public blowback that

14684
04:20:41,790 --> 04:20:41,800
you would receive public blowback that
 

14685
04:20:41,800 --> 04:20:42,910
you would receive public blowback that
kind of thing so you have to do do it

14686
04:20:42,910 --> 04:20:42,920
kind of thing so you have to do do it
 

14687
04:20:42,920 --> 04:20:44,349
kind of thing so you have to do do it
loud enough to where it's clear it's an

14688
04:20:44,349 --> 04:20:44,359
loud enough to where it's clear it's an
 

14689
04:20:44,359 --> 04:20:46,830
loud enough to where it's clear it's an
ad and balance all that so that's the

14690
04:20:46,830 --> 04:20:46,840
ad and balance all that so that's the
 

14691
04:20:46,840 --> 04:20:48,670
ad and balance all that so that's the
open question they're trying to solve

14692
04:20:48,670 --> 04:20:48,680
open question they're trying to solve
 

14693
04:20:48,680 --> 04:20:51,630
open question they're trying to solve
anthropic and open AI they need to they

14694
04:20:51,630 --> 04:20:51,640
anthropic and open AI they need to they
 

14695
04:20:51,640 --> 04:20:53,189
anthropic and open AI they need to they
might not say they care about that at

14696
04:20:53,189 --> 04:20:53,199
might not say they care about that at
 

14697
04:20:53,199 --> 04:20:54,990
might not say they care about that at
all they don't care about it right now I

14698
04:20:54,990 --> 04:20:55,000
all they don't care about it right now I
 

14699
04:20:55,000 --> 04:20:57,550
all they don't care about it right now I
think it's places like are experimenting

14700
04:20:57,550 --> 04:20:57,560
think it's places like are experimenting
 

14701
04:20:57,560 --> 04:21:00,750
think it's places like are experimenting
on that more oh interesting yeah for

14702
04:21:00,750 --> 04:21:00,760
on that more oh interesting yeah for
 

14703
04:21:00,760 --> 04:21:02,630
on that more oh interesting yeah for
sure like perplexity Google Meta Care

14704
04:21:02,630 --> 04:21:02,640
sure like perplexity Google Meta Care
 

14705
04:21:02,640 --> 04:21:05,349
sure like perplexity Google Meta Care
about this um I think open eye and

14706
04:21:05,349 --> 04:21:05,359
about this um I think open eye and
 

14707
04:21:05,359 --> 04:21:07,910
about this um I think open eye and
anthropic are purely laser focused on

14708
04:21:07,910 --> 04:21:07,920
anthropic are purely laser focused on
 

14709
04:21:07,920 --> 04:21:11,389
anthropic are purely laser focused on
AGI yeah agents and AGI and if I build

14710
04:21:11,389 --> 04:21:11,399
AGI yeah agents and AGI and if I build
 

14711
04:21:11,399 --> 04:21:14,670
AGI yeah agents and AGI and if I build
AGI I can make tons of money right or I

14712
04:21:14,670 --> 04:21:14,680
AGI I can make tons of money right or I
 

14713
04:21:14,680 --> 04:21:16,030
AGI I can make tons of money right or I
can spend pay for everything right and

14714
04:21:16,030 --> 04:21:16,040
can spend pay for everything right and
 

14715
04:21:16,040 --> 04:21:18,910
can spend pay for everything right and
this is this is It's just predicated

14716
04:21:18,910 --> 04:21:18,920
this is this is It's just predicated
 

14717
04:21:18,920 --> 04:21:20,229
this is this is It's just predicated
like back on the like export control

14718
04:21:20,229 --> 04:21:20,239
like back on the like export control
 

14719
04:21:20,239 --> 04:21:22,510
like back on the like export control
thing right if you think AGI is 5 10

14720
04:21:22,510 --> 04:21:22,520
thing right if you think AGI is 5 10
 

14721
04:21:22,520 --> 04:21:24,109
thing right if you think AGI is 5 10
years away or less right these Labs

14722
04:21:24,109 --> 04:21:24,119
years away or less right these Labs
 

14723
04:21:24,119 --> 04:21:26,070
years away or less right these Labs
think it's two three years away

14724
04:21:26,070 --> 04:21:26,080
think it's two three years away
 

14725
04:21:26,080 --> 04:21:28,229
think it's two three years away
obviously your your your your actions

14726
04:21:28,229 --> 04:21:28,239
obviously your your your your actions
 

14727
04:21:28,239 --> 04:21:30,269
obviously your your your your actions
are you know if you assume they're

14728
04:21:30,269 --> 04:21:30,279
are you know if you assume they're
 

14729
04:21:30,279 --> 04:21:33,269
are you know if you assume they're
rational actors which they are mostly um

14730
04:21:33,269 --> 04:21:33,279
rational actors which they are mostly um
 

14731
04:21:33,279 --> 04:21:35,550
rational actors which they are mostly um
you're what you do in a two-year AGI

14732
04:21:35,550 --> 04:21:35,560
you're what you do in a two-year AGI
 

14733
04:21:35,560 --> 04:21:37,590
you're what you do in a two-year AGI
versus fiveyear versus 10 years very

14734
04:21:37,590 --> 04:21:37,600
versus fiveyear versus 10 years very
 

14735
04:21:37,600 --> 04:21:40,309
versus fiveyear versus 10 years very
very very different right do you think

14736
04:21:40,309 --> 04:21:40,319
very very different right do you think
 

14737
04:21:40,319 --> 04:21:42,950
very very different right do you think
agents are promising we have to talk

14738
04:21:42,950 --> 04:21:42,960
agents are promising we have to talk
 

14739
04:21:42,960 --> 04:21:46,670
agents are promising we have to talk
about this this was uh this is like the

14740
04:21:46,670 --> 04:21:46,680
about this this was uh this is like the
 

14741
04:21:46,680 --> 04:21:48,670
about this this was uh this is like the
excitement of the year that agents are

14742
04:21:48,670 --> 04:21:48,680
excitement of the year that agents are
 

14743
04:21:48,680 --> 04:21:51,030
excitement of the year that agents are
going to re this is the

14744
04:21:51,030 --> 04:21:51,040
going to re this is the
 

14745
04:21:51,040 --> 04:21:53,950
going to re this is the
generic hype term that a lot of business

14746
04:21:53,950 --> 04:21:53,960
generic hype term that a lot of business
 

14747
04:21:53,960 --> 04:21:56,030
generic hype term that a lot of business
folks are using AI agents are going to

14748
04:21:56,030 --> 04:21:56,040
folks are using AI agents are going to
 

14749
04:21:56,040 --> 04:21:58,750
folks are using AI agents are going to
revolutionize everything okay so mostly

14750
04:21:58,750 --> 04:21:58,760
revolutionize everything okay so mostly
 

14751
04:21:58,760 --> 04:22:00,030
revolutionize everything okay so mostly
the the term agent is obviously

14752
04:22:00,030 --> 04:22:00,040
the the term agent is obviously
 

14753
04:22:00,040 --> 04:22:01,830
the the term agent is obviously
overblown we've talked a lot about

14754
04:22:01,830 --> 04:22:01,840
overblown we've talked a lot about
 

14755
04:22:01,840 --> 04:22:03,830
overblown we've talked a lot about
reinforcement learning as a way to train

reinforcement learning as a way to train
 

14757
04:22:03,840 --> 04:22:06,630
reinforcement learning as a way to train
for verifiable outcomes agents should

14758
04:22:06,630 --> 04:22:06,640
for verifiable outcomes agents should
 

14759
04:22:06,640 --> 04:22:08,630
for verifiable outcomes agents should
mean something that is open-ended and is

14760
04:22:08,630 --> 04:22:08,640
mean something that is open-ended and is
 

14761
04:22:08,640 --> 04:22:10,469
mean something that is open-ended and is
solving a task independently on its own

and able to adapt to uncertainty there's
 

14765
04:22:12,880 --> 04:22:14,790
and able to adapt to uncertainty there's
a lot of term agent applied to things

14766
04:22:14,790 --> 04:22:14,800
a lot of term agent applied to things
 

14767
04:22:14,800 --> 04:22:16,910
a lot of term agent applied to things
like apple intelligence which we still

14768
04:22:16,910 --> 04:22:16,920
like apple intelligence which we still
 

14769
04:22:16,920 --> 04:22:20,070
like apple intelligence which we still
don't have after the last WWDC which is

orchestrating between apps and that type
 

14773
04:22:22,840 --> 04:22:24,229
orchestrating between apps and that type
of tool use thing is something that

14774
04:22:24,229 --> 04:22:24,239
of tool use thing is something that
 

14775
04:22:24,239 --> 04:22:26,469
of tool use thing is something that
language models can do really well Apple

get into the narrative the question is
 

14791
04:22:43,479 --> 04:22:46,870
get into the narrative the question is
what ways can we get language models to

is the idea of storing information in a
prompt and you can use learning

know if you've seen the five levels
right where it's chat is level one

14834
04:23:31,309 --> 04:23:31,319
right where it's chat is level one
 

14835
04:23:31,319 --> 04:23:33,830
right where it's chat is level one
reasoning is level two and then agents

14836
04:23:33,830 --> 04:23:33,840
reasoning is level two and then agents
 

14837
04:23:33,840 --> 04:23:34,950
reasoning is level two and then agents
is level three and I think there's a

14838
04:23:34,950 --> 04:23:34,960
is level three and I think there's a
 

14839
04:23:34,960 --> 04:23:36,910
is level three and I think there's a
couple more levels but it's important to

14840
04:23:36,910 --> 04:23:36,920
couple more levels but it's important to
 

14841
04:23:36,920 --> 04:23:39,070
couple more levels but it's important to
note right we were in chat for a couple

14842
04:23:39,070 --> 04:23:39,080
note right we were in chat for a couple
 

14843
04:23:39,080 --> 04:23:41,349
note right we were in chat for a couple
years right we just theoretically got to

14844
04:23:41,349 --> 04:23:41,359
years right we just theoretically got to
 

14845
04:23:41,359 --> 04:23:44,070
years right we just theoretically got to
reasoning will be here for a year or two

14846
04:23:44,070 --> 04:23:44,080
reasoning will be here for a year or two
 

14847
04:23:44,080 --> 04:23:45,870
reasoning will be here for a year or two
right and then agents but at the same

14848
04:23:45,870 --> 04:23:45,880
right and then agents but at the same
 

14849
04:23:45,880 --> 04:23:48,149
right and then agents but at the same
time like people can people can try and

14850
04:23:48,149 --> 04:23:48,159
time like people can people can try and
 

14851
04:23:48,159 --> 04:23:49,910
time like people can people can try and
like approximate capabilities of the

14852
04:23:49,910 --> 04:23:49,920
like approximate capabilities of the
 

14853
04:23:49,920 --> 04:23:52,429
like approximate capabilities of the
next level but the AG agents are doing

14854
04:23:52,429 --> 04:23:52,439
next level but the AG agents are doing
 

14855
04:23:52,439 --> 04:23:54,149
next level but the AG agents are doing
things autonomously doing things for

14856
04:23:54,149 --> 04:23:54,159
things autonomously doing things for
 

14857
04:23:54,159 --> 04:23:56,229
things autonomously doing things for
minutes at a time hours at a time Etc

14858
04:23:56,229 --> 04:23:56,239
minutes at a time hours at a time Etc
 

14859
04:23:56,239 --> 04:24:00,309
minutes at a time hours at a time Etc
right uh reasoning is doing things for

14860
04:24:00,309 --> 04:24:00,319
right uh reasoning is doing things for
 

14861
04:24:00,319 --> 04:24:02,070
right uh reasoning is doing things for
tens of seconds at a time right and then

14862
04:24:02,070 --> 04:24:02,080
tens of seconds at a time right and then
 

14863
04:24:02,080 --> 04:24:03,229
tens of seconds at a time right and then
coming back with an output that I still

14864
04:24:03,229 --> 04:24:03,239
coming back with an output that I still
 

14865
04:24:03,239 --> 04:24:05,189
coming back with an output that I still
need to verify and use and try check out

14866
04:24:05,189 --> 04:24:05,199
need to verify and use and try check out
 

14867
04:24:05,199 --> 04:24:07,469
need to verify and use and try check out
right um so so and the biggest problem

14868
04:24:07,469 --> 04:24:07,479
right um so so and the biggest problem
 

14869
04:24:07,479 --> 04:24:09,950
right um so so and the biggest problem
is of course like um it's the same thing

14870
04:24:09,950 --> 04:24:09,960
is of course like um it's the same thing
 

14871
04:24:09,960 --> 04:24:11,149
is of course like um it's the same thing
with manufacturing right like there's

14872
04:24:11,149 --> 04:24:11,159
with manufacturing right like there's
 

14873
04:24:11,159 --> 04:24:12,830
with manufacturing right like there's
the whole Six Sigma thing right like you

14874
04:24:12,830 --> 04:24:12,840
the whole Six Sigma thing right like you
 

14875
04:24:12,840 --> 04:24:14,149
the whole Six Sigma thing right like you
know how many nines do you get and then

14876
04:24:14,149 --> 04:24:14,159
know how many nines do you get and then
 

14877
04:24:14,159 --> 04:24:16,109
know how many nines do you get and then
you compound the nines onto each other

14878
04:24:16,109 --> 04:24:16,119
you compound the nines onto each other
 

14879
04:24:16,119 --> 04:24:17,990
you compound the nines onto each other
and it's like if you multiply you know

14880
04:24:17,990 --> 04:24:18,000
and it's like if you multiply you know
 

14881
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:19,710
and it's like if you multiply you know
by the number of steps that are Six

14882
04:24:19,710 --> 04:24:19,720
by the number of steps that are Six
 

14883
04:24:19,720 --> 04:24:23,109
by the number of steps that are Six
Sigma you get to uh you know a Yi a

14884
04:24:23,109 --> 04:24:23,119
Sigma you get to uh you know a Yi a
 

14885
04:24:23,119 --> 04:24:24,229
Sigma you get to uh you know a Yi a
yield or something right so like in

14886
04:24:24,229 --> 04:24:24,239
yield or something right so like in
 

14887
04:24:24,239 --> 04:24:25,870
yield or something right so like in
semiconductor manufacturing tens of

14888
04:24:25,870 --> 04:24:25,880
semiconductor manufacturing tens of
 

14889
04:24:25,880 --> 04:24:27,710
semiconductor manufacturing tens of
thousands of steps

14890
04:24:27,710 --> 04:24:27,720
thousands of steps
 

14891
04:24:27,720 --> 04:24:30,229
thousands of steps
9999999 is not enough right because you

14892
04:24:30,229 --> 04:24:30,239
9999999 is not enough right because you
 

14893
04:24:30,239 --> 04:24:31,870
9999999 is not enough right because you
multiply by that by that many times you

14894
04:24:31,870 --> 04:24:31,880
multiply by that by that many times you
 

14895
04:24:31,880 --> 04:24:33,510
multiply by that by that many times you
actually end up with like 60% yield

14896
04:24:33,510 --> 04:24:33,520
actually end up with like 60% yield
 

14897
04:24:33,520 --> 04:24:36,469
actually end up with like 60% yield
right really low yield yeah or zero um

14898
04:24:36,469 --> 04:24:36,479
right really low yield yeah or zero um
 

14899
04:24:36,479 --> 04:24:37,630
right really low yield yeah or zero um
and this is the same thing with agents

14900
04:24:37,630 --> 04:24:37,640
and this is the same thing with agents
 

14901
04:24:37,640 --> 04:24:39,750
and this is the same thing with agents
right like chaining tasks together each

14902
04:24:39,750 --> 04:24:39,760
right like chaining tasks together each
 

14903
04:24:39,760 --> 04:24:43,870
right like chaining tasks together each
time llms even the best LMS in

14904
04:24:43,870 --> 04:24:43,880
time llms even the best LMS in
 

14905
04:24:43,880 --> 04:24:45,710
time llms even the best LMS in
particularly pretty good benchmarks

14906
04:24:45,710 --> 04:24:45,720
particularly pretty good benchmarks
 

14907
04:24:45,720 --> 04:24:48,630
particularly pretty good benchmarks
don't get 100% right they get a little

14908
04:24:48,630 --> 04:24:48,640
don't get 100% right they get a little
 

14909
04:24:48,640 --> 04:24:49,950
don't get 100% right they get a little
bit below that because there's a lot of

14910
04:24:49,950 --> 04:24:49,960
bit below that because there's a lot of
 

14911
04:24:49,960 --> 04:24:53,870
bit below that because there's a lot of
noise um and so how do you get to enough

14912
04:24:53,870 --> 04:24:53,880
noise um and so how do you get to enough
 

14913
04:24:53,880 --> 04:24:55,189
noise um and so how do you get to enough
nines right this is the same thing with

14914
04:24:55,189 --> 04:24:55,199
nines right this is the same thing with
 

14915
04:24:55,199 --> 04:24:56,790
nines right this is the same thing with
self-driving we don't we can't have

14916
04:24:56,790 --> 04:24:56,800
self-driving we don't we can't have
 

14917
04:24:56,800 --> 04:24:58,630
self-driving we don't we can't have
self-driving because without it being

14918
04:24:58,630 --> 04:24:58,640
self-driving because without it being
 

14919
04:24:58,640 --> 04:25:00,349
self-driving because without it being
like super Geo fenced like Google like

14920
04:25:00,349 --> 04:25:00,359
like super Geo fenced like Google like
 

14921
04:25:00,359 --> 04:25:01,910
like super Geo fenced like Google like
Google's right and even then they have a

14922
04:25:01,910 --> 04:25:01,920
Google's right and even then they have a
 

14923
04:25:01,920 --> 04:25:03,229
Google's right and even then they have a
bunch of tele operators to make sure it

14924
04:25:03,229 --> 04:25:03,239
bunch of tele operators to make sure it
 

14925
04:25:03,239 --> 04:25:05,349
bunch of tele operators to make sure it
doesn't get stuck right but you can't do

14926
04:25:05,349 --> 04:25:05,359
doesn't get stuck right but you can't do
 

14927
04:25:05,359 --> 04:25:06,670
doesn't get stuck right but you can't do
that because it doesn't have enough

14928
04:25:06,670 --> 04:25:06,680
that because it doesn't have enough
 

14929
04:25:06,680 --> 04:25:10,109
that because it doesn't have enough
nights and self-driving has quite a lot

14930
04:25:10,109 --> 04:25:10,119
nights and self-driving has quite a lot
 

14931
04:25:10,119 --> 04:25:12,750
nights and self-driving has quite a lot
of structure because roads have rules

14932
04:25:12,750 --> 04:25:12,760
of structure because roads have rules
 

14933
04:25:12,760 --> 04:25:15,429
of structure because roads have rules
it's well defined there's regulation

14934
04:25:15,429 --> 04:25:15,439
it's well defined there's regulation
 

14935
04:25:15,439 --> 04:25:17,790
it's well defined there's regulation
when you're talking about computer use

14936
04:25:17,790 --> 04:25:17,800
when you're talking about computer use
 

14937
04:25:17,800 --> 04:25:20,830
when you're talking about computer use
for the open web for example or the open

14938
04:25:20,830 --> 04:25:20,840
for the open web for example or the open
 

14939
04:25:20,840 --> 04:25:23,990
for the open web for example or the open
operating system like there's no it's a

14940
04:25:23,990 --> 04:25:24,000
operating system like there's no it's a
 

14941
04:25:24,000 --> 04:25:27,510
operating system like there's no it's a
mess so like the possibility I'm I'm

14942
04:25:27,510 --> 04:25:27,520
mess so like the possibility I'm I'm
 

14943
04:25:27,520 --> 04:25:30,189
mess so like the possibility I'm I'm
always skeptical of any system that is

14944
04:25:30,189 --> 04:25:30,199
always skeptical of any system that is
 

14945
04:25:30,199 --> 04:25:32,070
always skeptical of any system that is
tasked with

14946
04:25:32,070 --> 04:25:32,080
tasked with
 

14947
04:25:32,080 --> 04:25:34,870
tasked with
interacting with the human world with

14948
04:25:34,870 --> 04:25:34,880
interacting with the human world with
 

14949
04:25:34,880 --> 04:25:37,429
interacting with the human world with
the open Messy thing if we can't get

14950
04:25:37,429 --> 04:25:37,439
the open Messy thing if we can't get
 

14951
04:25:37,439 --> 04:25:39,830
the open Messy thing if we can't get
intelligence that's enough to solve the

14952
04:25:39,830 --> 04:25:39,840
intelligence that's enough to solve the
 

14953
04:25:39,840 --> 04:25:41,630
intelligence that's enough to solve the
human world on its own we can create

14954
04:25:41,630 --> 04:25:41,640
human world on its own we can create
 

14955
04:25:41,640 --> 04:25:42,870
human world on its own we can create
infrastructure

14956
04:25:42,870 --> 04:25:42,880
infrastructure
 

14957
04:25:42,880 --> 04:25:45,469
infrastructure
like the human operators for weo over

14958
04:25:45,469 --> 04:25:45,479
like the human operators for weo over
 

14959
04:25:45,479 --> 04:25:47,630
like the human operators for weo over
many years that enable certain workflows

14960
04:25:47,630 --> 04:25:47,640
many years that enable certain workflows
 

14961
04:25:47,640 --> 04:25:48,710
many years that enable certain workflows
there there is a company I don't

14962
04:25:48,710 --> 04:25:48,720
there there is a company I don't
 

14963
04:25:48,720 --> 04:25:49,950
there there is a company I don't
remember it but it is but that's

14964
04:25:49,950 --> 04:25:49,960
remember it but it is but that's
 

14965
04:25:49,960 --> 04:25:51,550
remember it but it is but that's
literally their pitches yeah we're just

14966
04:25:51,550 --> 04:25:51,560
literally their pitches yeah we're just
 

14967
04:25:51,560 --> 04:25:52,830
literally their pitches yeah we're just
going to be the human operator when

14968
04:25:52,830 --> 04:25:52,840
going to be the human operator when
 

14969
04:25:52,840 --> 04:25:54,550
going to be the human operator when
agents fail and you just call us and we

14970
04:25:54,550 --> 04:25:54,560
agents fail and you just call us and we
 

14971
04:25:54,560 --> 04:25:56,830
agents fail and you just call us and we
fix it yeah an API call and it's

14972
04:25:56,830 --> 04:25:56,840
fix it yeah an API call and it's
 

14973
04:25:56,840 --> 04:25:57,670
fix it yeah an API call and it's
hilarious there's going to be

14974
04:25:57,670 --> 04:25:57,680
hilarious there's going to be
 

14975
04:25:57,680 --> 04:25:59,469
hilarious there's going to be
teleoperation markets when we get human

14976
04:25:59,469 --> 04:25:59,479
teleoperation markets when we get human
 

14977
04:25:59,479 --> 04:26:01,030
teleoperation markets when we get human
robots which is there's going to be

14978
04:26:01,030 --> 04:26:01,040
robots which is there's going to be
 

14979
04:26:01,040 --> 04:26:03,189
robots which is there's going to be
somebody around the world that's happy

14980
04:26:03,189 --> 04:26:03,199
somebody around the world that's happy
 

14981
04:26:03,199 --> 04:26:04,870
somebody around the world that's happy
to fix the fact that it can't finish

14982
04:26:04,870 --> 04:26:04,880
to fix the fact that it can't finish
 

14983
04:26:04,880 --> 04:26:07,109
to fix the fact that it can't finish

AI agents but if you can make things
 

14997
04:26:21,720 --> 04:26:23,990
AI agents but if you can make things
that are good at one step you can just

14998
04:26:23,990 --> 04:26:24,000
that are good at one step you can just
 

14999
04:26:24,000 --> 04:26:25,469
that are good at one step you can just
you can stack them together so that's

and the models went from 4% to 60% in

15284
04:31:19,670 --> 04:31:19,680
and the models went from 4% to 60% in
 

15285
04:31:19,680 --> 04:31:22,590
and the models went from 4% to 60% in
like a year right um and where are they

15286
04:31:22,590 --> 04:31:22,600
like a year right um and where are they
 

15287
04:31:22,600 --> 04:31:24,269
like a year right um and where are they
going to go to next year you know it's

15288
04:31:24,269 --> 04:31:24,279
going to go to next year you know it's
 

15289
04:31:24,279 --> 04:31:25,870
going to go to next year you know it's
going to be higher probably won't be

15290
04:31:25,870 --> 04:31:25,880
going to be higher probably won't be
 

15291
04:31:25,880 --> 04:31:27,389
going to be higher probably won't be
100% because again that nines is like

15292
04:31:27,389 --> 04:31:27,399
100% because again that nines is like
 

15293
04:31:27,399 --> 04:31:29,550
100% because again that nines is like
really hard to do uh but we're going to

15294
04:31:29,550 --> 04:31:29,560
really hard to do uh but we're going to
 

15295
04:31:29,560 --> 04:31:30,870
really hard to do uh but we're going to
get to some point where that's and then

15296
04:31:30,870 --> 04:31:30,880
get to some point where that's and then
 

15297
04:31:30,880 --> 04:31:31,790
get to some point where that's and then
we're going to need harder software

15298
04:31:31,790 --> 04:31:31,800
we're going to need harder software
 

15299
04:31:31,800 --> 04:31:33,550
we're going to need harder software
engineering benchmarks and so on and so

15300
04:31:33,550 --> 04:31:33,560
engineering benchmarks and so on and so
 

15301
04:31:33,560 --> 04:31:36,710
engineering benchmarks and so on and so
forth but the the way that like people

15302
04:31:36,710 --> 04:31:36,720
forth but the the way that like people
 

15303
04:31:36,720 --> 04:31:38,109
forth but the the way that like people
think of it now is it's can do code

15304
04:31:38,109 --> 04:31:38,119
think of it now is it's can do code
 

15305
04:31:38,119 --> 04:31:39,870
think of it now is it's can do code
completion easy it can do some function

15306
04:31:39,870 --> 04:31:39,880
completion easy it can do some function
 

15307
04:31:39,880 --> 04:31:41,990
completion easy it can do some function
generation and have to review it great

15308
04:31:41,990 --> 04:31:42,000
generation and have to review it great
 

15309
04:31:42,000 --> 04:31:44,030
generation and have to review it great
but really the the like software

15310
04:31:44,030 --> 04:31:44,040
but really the the like software
 

15311
04:31:44,040 --> 04:31:45,830
but really the the like software
engineering agents I think can be done

15312
04:31:45,830 --> 04:31:45,840
engineering agents I think can be done
 

15313
04:31:45,840 --> 04:31:47,630
engineering agents I think can be done
faster sooner than any other agent

15314
04:31:47,630 --> 04:31:47,640
faster sooner than any other agent
 

15315
04:31:47,640 --> 04:31:50,349
faster sooner than any other agent
because it is a verifiable domain um you

15316
04:31:50,349 --> 04:31:50,359
because it is a verifiable domain um you
 

15317
04:31:50,359 --> 04:31:53,189
because it is a verifiable domain um you
can always like unit test or compile um

15318
04:31:53,189 --> 04:31:53,199
can always like unit test or compile um
 

15319
04:31:53,199 --> 04:31:54,630
can always like unit test or compile um
and and and there's many different

15320
04:31:54,630 --> 04:31:54,640
and and and there's many different
 

15321
04:31:54,640 --> 04:31:57,950
and and and there's many different
regions of like it can inspect the whole

15322
04:31:57,950 --> 04:31:57,960
regions of like it can inspect the whole
 

15323
04:31:57,960 --> 04:32:00,070
regions of like it can inspect the whole
code base at once which no no engineer

15324
04:32:00,070 --> 04:32:00,080
code base at once which no no engineer
 

15325
04:32:00,080 --> 04:32:01,590
code base at once which no no engineer
really can only The Architects can

15326
04:32:01,590 --> 04:32:01,600
really can only The Architects can
 

15327
04:32:01,600 --> 04:32:02,870
really can only The Architects can
really think about this stuff the really

15328
04:32:02,870 --> 04:32:02,880
really think about this stuff the really
 

15329
04:32:02,880 --> 04:32:05,389
really think about this stuff the really
senior guys and they can Define stuff um

15330
04:32:05,389 --> 04:32:05,399
senior guys and they can Define stuff um
 

15331
04:32:05,399 --> 04:32:07,030
senior guys and they can Define stuff um
and then the agent can execute on it so

15332
04:32:07,030 --> 04:32:07,040
and then the agent can execute on it so
 

15333
04:32:07,040 --> 04:32:08,229
and then the agent can execute on it so
I think I think software engineering

15334
04:32:08,229 --> 04:32:08,239
I think I think software engineering
 

15335
04:32:08,239 --> 04:32:10,070
I think I think software engineering
costs are going to plummet like crazy

15336
04:32:10,070 --> 04:32:10,080
costs are going to plummet like crazy
 

15337
04:32:10,080 --> 04:32:12,269
costs are going to plummet like crazy
and and one interesting aspect of that

15338
04:32:12,269 --> 04:32:12,279
and and one interesting aspect of that
 

15339
04:32:12,279 --> 04:32:13,750
and and one interesting aspect of that
is when software engineering costs are

15340
04:32:13,750 --> 04:32:13,760
is when software engineering costs are
 

15341
04:32:13,760 --> 04:32:15,630
is when software engineering costs are
really low you get very different

15342
04:32:15,630 --> 04:32:15,640
really low you get very different
 

15343
04:32:15,640 --> 04:32:17,710
really low you get very different
markets right so in the US you have all

15344
04:32:17,710 --> 04:32:17,720
markets right so in the US you have all
 

15345
04:32:17,720 --> 04:32:19,309
markets right so in the US you have all
these platforms ass companies right

15346
04:32:19,309 --> 04:32:19,319
these platforms ass companies right
 

15347
04:32:19,319 --> 04:32:22,030
these platforms ass companies right
Salesforce and so on and so forth right

15348
04:32:22,030 --> 04:32:22,040
Salesforce and so on and so forth right
 

15349
04:32:22,040 --> 04:32:25,830
Salesforce and so on and so forth right
in in China no one uses platform SAS

15350
04:32:25,830 --> 04:32:25,840
in in China no one uses platform SAS
 

15351
04:32:25,840 --> 04:32:27,550
in in China no one uses platform SAS
everyone just builds their own stack

15352
04:32:27,550 --> 04:32:27,560
everyone just builds their own stack
 

15353
04:32:27,560 --> 04:32:29,870
everyone just builds their own stack
because software engineering is much

15354
04:32:29,870 --> 04:32:29,880
because software engineering is much
 

15355
04:32:29,880 --> 04:32:31,870
because software engineering is much
cheaper in China partially because like

15356
04:32:31,870 --> 04:32:31,880
cheaper in China partially because like
 

15357
04:32:31,880 --> 04:32:34,590
cheaper in China partially because like
people stem number of stem graduates Etc

15358
04:32:34,590 --> 04:32:34,600
people stem number of stem graduates Etc
 

15359
04:32:34,600 --> 04:32:35,950
people stem number of stem graduates Etc
uh so stem so it's generally just

15360
04:32:35,950 --> 04:32:35,960
uh so stem so it's generally just
 

15361
04:32:35,960 --> 04:32:39,590
uh so stem so it's generally just
cheaper to do um and so at the same time

15362
04:32:39,590 --> 04:32:39,600
cheaper to do um and so at the same time
 

15363
04:32:39,600 --> 04:32:41,429
cheaper to do um and so at the same time
code for L like code llms have been

15364
04:32:41,429 --> 04:32:41,439
code for L like code llms have been
 

15365
04:32:41,439 --> 04:32:42,950
code for L like code llms have been
adopted much less in China because the

15366
04:32:42,950 --> 04:32:42,960
adopted much less in China because the
 

15367
04:32:42,960 --> 04:32:45,149
adopted much less in China because the
cost of an engineer there is much lower

15368
04:32:45,149 --> 04:32:45,159
cost of an engineer there is much lower
 

15369
04:32:45,159 --> 04:32:46,790
cost of an engineer there is much lower
but like what happens when every company

15370
04:32:46,790 --> 04:32:46,800
but like what happens when every company
 

15371
04:32:46,800 --> 04:32:48,389
but like what happens when every company
can just invent their own business logic

15372
04:32:48,389 --> 04:32:48,399
can just invent their own business logic
 

15373
04:32:48,399 --> 04:32:50,229
can just invent their own business logic
like really cheaply and quickly you stop

15374
04:32:50,229 --> 04:32:50,239
like really cheaply and quickly you stop
 

15375
04:32:50,239 --> 04:32:52,030
like really cheaply and quickly you stop
using platform SAS you start building

15376
04:32:52,030 --> 04:32:52,040
using platform SAS you start building
 

15377
04:32:52,040 --> 04:32:53,990
using platform SAS you start building
custom tailored Solutions you change

15378
04:32:53,990 --> 04:32:54,000
custom tailored Solutions you change
 

15379
04:32:54,000 --> 04:32:55,469
custom tailored Solutions you change
them really quickly now all of a sudden

15380
04:32:55,469 --> 04:32:55,479
them really quickly now all of a sudden
 

15381
04:32:55,479 --> 04:32:56,510
them really quickly now all of a sudden
your business is a little bit more

15382
04:32:56,510 --> 04:32:56,520
your business is a little bit more
 

15383
04:32:56,520 --> 04:32:57,670
your business is a little bit more
efficient too potentially because you're

15384
04:32:57,670 --> 04:32:57,680
efficient too potentially because you're
 

15385
04:32:57,680 --> 04:32:59,550
efficient too potentially because you're
not dealing with the hell that is like

15386
04:32:59,550 --> 04:32:59,560
not dealing with the hell that is like
 

15387
04:32:59,560 --> 04:33:01,910
not dealing with the hell that is like
some random platform SAS company stuff

15388

AI required it's just logic that needs

15396
04:33:08,830 --> 04:33:08,840
AI required it's just logic that needs
 

15397
04:33:08,840 --> 04:33:10,269
AI required it's just logic that needs
to be built that no one has built right

all of these things can go happen fast I

15400
04:33:12,189 --> 04:33:12,199
all of these things can go happen fast I
 

15401
04:33:12,199 --> 04:33:13,709
all of these things can go happen fast I
think software and then and then the

15402
04:33:13,709 --> 04:33:13,719
think software and then and then the
 

15403
04:33:13,719 --> 04:33:15,670
think software and then and then the
other domain is like industrial chemical

mechanical engineers suck at coding
 

15407
04:33:17,879 --> 04:33:19,910
mechanical engineers suck at coding
right uh just generally and like their

04:33:19,910 --> 04:33:19,920
right uh just generally and like their
 

15409
04:33:19,920 --> 04:33:21,150
right uh just generally and like their
tools like semiconductor Engineers their

15415
04:33:25,439 --> 04:33:27,510
on XP including asml lithography tools
run on Windows XP right it's like you

15416
04:33:27,510 --> 04:33:27,520
run on Windows XP right it's like you
 

15417
04:33:27,520 --> 04:33:29,709
run on Windows XP right it's like you
know and and like a lot of the analysis

15418
04:33:29,709 --> 04:33:29,719
know and and like a lot of the analysis
 

15419
04:33:29,719 --> 04:33:31,830
know and and like a lot of the analysis
happens in Excel right like it's just

15420
04:33:31,830 --> 04:33:31,840
happens in Excel right like it's just
 

15421
04:33:31,840 --> 04:33:33,551
happens in Excel right like it's just
like guys like you guys can move 20

15422
04:33:33,551 --> 04:33:33,561
like guys like you guys can move 20
 

15423
04:33:33,561 --> 04:33:34,990
like guys like you guys can move 20
years forward with all the data you have

15424
04:33:34,990 --> 04:33:35,000
years forward with all the data you have
 

15425
04:33:35,000 --> 04:33:36,590
years forward with all the data you have
and gathered and like do a lot better

15426
04:33:36,590 --> 04:33:36,600
and gathered and like do a lot better
 

15427
04:33:36,600 --> 04:33:38,390
and gathered and like do a lot better
it's just you need the engineering

15428
04:33:38,390 --> 04:33:38,400
it's just you need the engineering
 

15429
04:33:38,400 --> 04:33:40,109
it's just you need the engineering
skills for software engineering to be

15430
04:33:40,109 --> 04:33:40,119
skills for software engineering to be
 

15431
04:33:40,119 --> 04:33:42,230
skills for software engineering to be
delivered to the actual domain expert so

15432
04:33:42,230 --> 04:33:42,240
delivered to the actual domain expert so
 

15433
04:33:42,240 --> 04:33:43,830
delivered to the actual domain expert so
I think I think that's the area where

15434
04:33:43,830 --> 04:33:43,840
I think I think that's the area where
 

15435
04:33:43,840 --> 04:33:45,670
I think I think that's the area where
I'm like super duper bullish of of

15436
04:33:45,670 --> 04:33:45,680
I'm like super duper bullish of of
 

15437
04:33:45,680 --> 04:33:47,990
I'm like super duper bullish of of
generally AI creating value the big

15438
04:33:47,990 --> 04:33:48,000
generally AI creating value the big
 

15439
04:33:48,000 --> 04:33:49,830
generally AI creating value the big
picture is that I don't think it's going

15440
04:33:49,830 --> 04:33:49,840
picture is that I don't think it's going
 

15441
04:33:49,840 --> 04:33:52,230
picture is that I don't think it's going
to be a cliff it's like we talked I

15442
04:33:52,230 --> 04:33:52,240
to be a cliff it's like we talked I
 

15443
04:33:52,240 --> 04:33:54,789
to be a cliff it's like we talked I
think the a really good example of how

15444
04:33:54,789 --> 04:33:54,799
think the a really good example of how
 

15445
04:33:54,799 --> 04:33:58,310
think the a really good example of how
growth changes is when meta added

15446
04:33:58,310 --> 04:33:58,320
growth changes is when meta added
 

15447
04:33:58,320 --> 04:33:59,789
growth changes is when meta added
stories so Snapchat was on an

15448
04:33:59,789 --> 04:33:59,799
stories so Snapchat was on an
 

15449
04:33:59,799 --> 04:34:01,750
stories so Snapchat was on an
exponential they added stories It

15450
04:34:01,750 --> 04:34:01,760
exponential they added stories It

flatlined software engineers then up and

15452
04:34:04,390 --> 04:34:04,400
flatlined software engineers then up and
 

15453
04:34:04,400 --> 04:34:06,590
flatlined software engineers then up and
to the right AI is going to come in it's

15454
04:34:06,590 --> 04:34:06,600
to the right AI is going to come in it's
 

15455
04:34:06,600 --> 04:34:08,230
to the right AI is going to come in it's
probably just going to be flat it's like

15456
04:34:08,230 --> 04:34:08,240
probably just going to be flat it's like
 

15457
04:34:08,240 --> 04:34:09,429
probably just going to be flat it's like
it's not like everyone's going to lose

15458
04:34:09,429 --> 04:34:09,439
it's not like everyone's going to lose
 

15459

it's not like everyone's going to lose
their job it's hard because the supply

15460
04:34:12,470 --> 04:34:12,480
their job it's hard because the supply
 

15461
04:34:12,480 --> 04:34:14,150
their job it's hard because the supply
corrects more slowly so the amount of

15462
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:14,160
corrects more slowly so the amount of
 

15463
04:34:14,160 --> 04:34:16,230
corrects more slowly so the amount of
students is still growing and that'll

15464
04:34:16,230 --> 04:34:16,240
students is still growing and that'll
 

15465
04:34:16,240 --> 04:34:18,390
students is still growing and that'll
correct on a multi-year like a year

15466
04:34:18,390 --> 04:34:18,400
correct on a multi-year like a year
 

15467
04:34:18,400 --> 04:34:20,949
correct on a multi-year like a year
delay but the amount of jobs will just

15468
04:34:20,949 --> 04:34:20,959
delay but the amount of jobs will just
 

15469
04:34:20,959 --> 04:34:24,830
delay but the amount of jobs will just
turn and then maybe in 20 40 Years it'll

15470
04:34:24,830 --> 04:34:24,840
turn and then maybe in 20 40 Years it'll
 

15471
04:34:24,840 --> 04:34:26,949
turn and then maybe in 20 40 Years it'll
be well down but in the few years

15472
04:34:26,949 --> 04:34:26,959
be well down but in the few years
 

15473
04:34:26,959 --> 04:34:28,150
be well down but in the few years
there'll never going to be the snap

15474
04:34:28,150 --> 04:34:28,160
there'll never going to be the snap
 

15475
04:34:28,160 --> 04:34:29,109
there'll never going to be the snap
moment where it's like software

Engineers aren't useful I I think also

15478
04:34:30,949 --> 04:34:30,959
Engineers aren't useful I I think also
 

15479
04:34:30,959 --> 04:34:32,349
Engineers aren't useful I I think also
the nature of what it means to be a

the nature of what it means to be a
 

15481
04:34:32,359 --> 04:34:33,949
the nature of what it means to be a
programmer and what kind of jobs

15482
04:34:33,949 --> 04:34:33,959
programmer and what kind of jobs
 

15483
04:34:33,959 --> 04:34:37,949
programmer and what kind of jobs
programmers do changes because I think

15484
04:34:37,949 --> 04:34:37,959
programmers do changes because I think
 

15485
04:34:37,959 --> 04:34:39,869
programmers do changes because I think

a good answer for a lot of problems but

15544
04:35:43,109 --> 04:35:43,119
a good answer for a lot of problems but
 

15545
04:35:43,119 --> 04:35:45,150
a good answer for a lot of problems but
it's easy to see which one is better and

15546
04:35:45,150 --> 04:35:45,160
it's easy to see which one is better and
 

15547
04:35:45,160 --> 04:35:46,949
it's easy to see which one is better and
that's how we're using a humans for AI

15548
04:35:46,949 --> 04:35:46,959
that's how we're using a humans for AI
 

15549
04:35:46,959 --> 04:35:48,949
that's how we're using a humans for AI
now is judging which one is better and

now is judging which one is better and
that's what's off for engineering could

look like is the pr review here's a few

15554
04:35:53,070 --> 04:35:53,080
look like is the pr review here's a few
 

15555
04:35:53,080 --> 04:35:55,310
look like is the pr review here's a few
options what are the like here are some

15556
04:35:55,310 --> 04:35:55,320
options what are the like here are some
 

15557
04:35:55,320 --> 04:35:57,470
options what are the like here are some
potential pros and cons and they're

15558
04:35:57,470 --> 04:35:57,480
potential pros and cons and they're
 

15559
04:35:57,480 --> 04:36:00,349
potential pros and cons and they're
going to be judge judges I I think the

15560
04:36:00,349 --> 04:36:00,359
going to be judge judges I I think the
 

15561
04:36:00,359 --> 04:36:02,789
going to be judge judges I I think the
thing I would very much recommend is

15562
04:36:02,789 --> 04:36:02,799
thing I would very much recommend is
 

15563
04:36:02,799 --> 04:36:05,029
thing I would very much recommend is
people start uh programmers start using

15567
04:36:07,680 --> 04:36:09,869
Ai and embracing that role of the
supervisor of the AI system and like

15568
04:36:09,869 --> 04:36:09,879

15569
04:36:09,879 --> 04:36:11,750
supervisor of the AI system and like

15570
04:36:11,750 --> 04:36:11,760
partner of the AI system verus is
 

15571

CU I think there actually has to be a

15576
04:36:18,109 --> 04:36:18,119
CU I think there actually has to be a
 

15577
04:36:18,119 --> 04:36:19,949
CU I think there actually has to be a
pretty high level of expertise as a

04:36:19,949 --> 04:36:19,959
pretty high level of expertise as a
 

15579
04:36:19,959 --> 04:36:22,269
pretty high level of expertise as a
programmer to be able to manage

15580

programmer to be able to manage
 

15581
04:36:22,279 --> 04:36:24,189
programmer to be able to manage
increasingly intelligent systems I think

15582
04:36:24,189 --> 04:36:24,199
increasingly intelligent systems I think
 

15583
04:36:24,199 --> 04:36:25,709
increasingly intelligent systems I think
it's I think it's that and then becoming

15584
04:36:25,709 --> 04:36:25,719
it's I think it's that and then becoming
 

15585
04:36:25,719 --> 04:36:28,029
it's I think it's that and then becoming

the early days after Chad GPT there was
 

15671
04:38:08,680 --> 04:38:10,830
the early days after Chad GPT there was
a big wave of models coming out like

15672
04:38:10,830 --> 04:38:10,840
a big wave of models coming out like
 

15673
04:38:10,840 --> 04:38:13,949
a big wave of models coming out like
alpaca AA Etc that were all named after

brand is multiple years old which comes
 

15679
04:38:18,920 --> 04:38:22,629
brand is multiple years old which comes
from that and we've been playing at the

15680
04:38:22,629 --> 04:38:22,639
from that and we've been playing at the
 

15681
04:38:22,639 --> 04:38:24,709
from that and we've been playing at the
frontiers of post training with open

15682
04:38:24,709 --> 04:38:24,719
frontiers of post training with open
 

15683
04:38:24,719 --> 04:38:27,789
frontiers of post training with open
source code and this first part of this

15684
04:38:27,789 --> 04:38:27,799
source code and this first part of this
 

15685
04:38:27,799 --> 04:38:30,189
source code and this first part of this
release was in the fall where we use we

15686
04:38:30,189 --> 04:38:30,199
release was in the fall where we use we
 

15687
04:38:30,199 --> 04:38:33,429
release was in the fall where we use we
built on llamas open models open weight

15688
04:38:33,429 --> 04:38:33,439
built on llamas open models open weight
 

15689
04:38:33,439 --> 04:38:35,551
built on llamas open models open weight
models and then we add in our fully open

15690
04:38:35,551 --> 04:38:35,561
models and then we add in our fully open
 

15691
04:38:35,561 --> 04:38:38,470
models and then we add in our fully open
code or fully open data there's a

15692
04:38:38,470 --> 04:38:38,480
code or fully open data there's a
 

15693
04:38:38,480 --> 04:38:40,789
code or fully open data there's a
popular Benchmark that is chapot Arena

15694
04:38:40,789 --> 04:38:40,799
popular Benchmark that is chapot Arena
 

15695
04:38:40,799 --> 04:38:42,629
popular Benchmark that is chapot Arena
and that's generally the metric by which

15696
04:38:42,629 --> 04:38:42,639
and that's generally the metric by which
 

15697
04:38:42,639 --> 04:38:45,189
and that's generally the metric by which
how these chat models are evaluated and

15698
04:38:45,189 --> 04:38:45,199
how these chat models are evaluated and
 

15699
04:38:45,199 --> 04:38:47,470
how these chat models are evaluated and
it's humans compare random models from

15700
04:38:47,470 --> 04:38:47,480
it's humans compare random models from
 

15701
04:38:47,480 --> 04:38:49,029
it's humans compare random models from
different organizations and if you

15702
04:38:49,029 --> 04:38:49,039
different organizations and if you
 

15703
04:38:49,039 --> 04:38:50,670
different organizations and if you
looked at the leaderboard in November or

15704
04:38:50,670 --> 04:38:50,680
looked at the leaderboard in November or
 

15705
04:38:50,680 --> 04:38:53,949
looked at the leaderboard in November or
December among the top 60 models from

15706
04:38:53,949 --> 04:38:53,959
December among the top 60 models from
 

15707
04:38:53,959 --> 04:38:55,949
December among the top 60 models from
tens to 20s of organizations none of

15708
04:38:55,949 --> 04:38:55,959
tens to 20s of organizations none of
 

15709
04:38:55,959 --> 04:38:57,910
tens to 20s of organizations none of
them had open code or data for just post

15710
04:38:57,910 --> 04:38:57,920
them had open code or data for just post
 

15711
04:38:57,920 --> 04:39:00,189
them had open code or data for just post
trining among that even fewer or none

15712
04:39:00,189 --> 04:39:00,199
trining among that even fewer or none
 

15713
04:39:00,199 --> 04:39:01,510
trining among that even fewer or none
have pre-training data and code

15714
04:39:01,510 --> 04:39:01,520
have pre-training data and code
 

15715
04:39:01,520 --> 04:39:03,230
have pre-training data and code
available but it's like posttraining is

15716
04:39:03,230 --> 04:39:03,240
available but it's like posttraining is
 

15717
04:39:03,240 --> 04:39:04,470
available but it's like posttraining is
much more accessible at this time it's

15718
04:39:04,470 --> 04:39:04,480
much more accessible at this time it's
 

15719
04:39:04,480 --> 04:39:06,390
much more accessible at this time it's
still pretty cheap and you can do it and

15720
04:39:06,390 --> 04:39:06,400
still pretty cheap and you can do it and
 

15721
04:39:06,400 --> 04:39:08,029
still pretty cheap and you can do it and
the thing is like how high can we push

15722
04:39:08,029 --> 04:39:08,039
the thing is like how high can we push
 

15723
04:39:08,039 --> 04:39:10,070
the thing is like how high can we push
this number where people have access to

15724
04:39:10,070 --> 04:39:10,080
this number where people have access to
 

15725
04:39:10,080 --> 04:39:11,750
this number where people have access to
all the code and data so that's kind of

15726
04:39:11,750 --> 04:39:11,760
all the code and data so that's kind of
 

15727
04:39:11,760 --> 04:39:13,189
all the code and data so that's kind of
the motivation of the project we draw in

15728
04:39:13,189 --> 04:39:13,199
the motivation of the project we draw in
 

15729
04:39:13,199 --> 04:39:16,429
the motivation of the project we draw in

04:39:22,680 --> 04:39:24,230
and a paper and it's putting all these
together to try to create a recipe that

15738
04:39:24,230 --> 04:39:24,240
together to try to create a recipe that
 

15739
04:39:24,240 --> 04:39:26,910
together to try to create a recipe that
people can fine-tune models like gp4 to

15740
04:39:26,910 --> 04:39:26,920
people can fine-tune models like gp4 to
 

15741
04:39:26,920 --> 04:39:29,590
people can fine-tune models like gp4 to
their domain so to be clear in the case

15742
04:39:29,590 --> 04:39:29,600
their domain so to be clear in the case
 

15743
04:39:29,600 --> 04:39:31,750
their domain so to be clear in the case
of Tulu maybe you can talk about Almo

15744
04:39:31,750 --> 04:39:31,760
of Tulu maybe you can talk about Almo
 

15745
04:39:31,760 --> 04:39:33,551
of Tulu maybe you can talk about Almo
too but in the case of Tulu you're

15746
04:39:33,551 --> 04:39:33,561
too but in the case of Tulu you're
 

15747
04:39:33,561 --> 04:39:35,189
too but in the case of Tulu you're
taking

15748
04:39:35,189 --> 04:39:35,199
taking
 

15749
04:39:35,199 --> 04:39:37,788
taking
llama 3

15750
04:39:37,788 --> 04:39:37,798
llama 3
 

15751
04:39:37,798 --> 04:39:40,510
llama 3
45b Tulu has been a series of recipes

15752
04:39:40,510 --> 04:39:40,520
45b Tulu has been a series of recipes
 

15753
04:39:40,520 --> 04:39:42,430
45b Tulu has been a series of recipes
for post training so we've done multiple

15754
04:39:42,430 --> 04:39:42,440
for post training so we've done multiple
 

15755
04:39:42,440 --> 04:39:44,830
for post training so we've done multiple
models over years yeah and so you're

15756
04:39:44,830 --> 04:39:44,840
models over years yeah and so you're
 

15757
04:39:44,840 --> 04:39:47,230
models over years yeah and so you're
open sourcing everything yeah if you

15758
04:39:47,230 --> 04:39:47,240
open sourcing everything yeah if you
 

15759
04:39:47,240 --> 04:39:49,030
open sourcing everything yeah if you
start with an open weight based model

15760
04:39:49,030 --> 04:39:49,040
start with an open weight based model
 

15761
04:39:49,040 --> 04:39:50,990
start with an open weight based model
the like whole model technically is an

15762
04:39:50,990 --> 04:39:51,000
the like whole model technically is an
 

15763
04:39:51,000 --> 04:39:52,150
the like whole model technically is an
open source because you don't know what

15764
04:39:52,150 --> 04:39:52,160
open source because you don't know what
 

15765
04:39:52,160 --> 04:39:54,590
open source because you don't know what
llama put into it which is why we have

15766
04:39:54,590 --> 04:39:54,600
llama put into it which is why we have
 

15767
04:39:54,600 --> 04:39:55,990
llama put into it which is why we have
the separate thing that we'll get to but

15768
04:39:55,990 --> 04:39:56,000
the separate thing that we'll get to but
 

15769
04:39:56,000 --> 04:39:58,350
the separate thing that we'll get to but
it's just getting parts of the pipeline

15770
04:39:58,350 --> 04:39:58,360
it's just getting parts of the pipeline
 

15771
04:39:58,360 --> 04:40:00,270
it's just getting parts of the pipeline
where people can zoom in and customize I

15772
04:40:00,270 --> 04:40:00,280
where people can zoom in and customize I
 

15773
04:40:00,280 --> 04:40:01,788
where people can zoom in and customize I
know I hear from startups and businesses

15774
04:40:01,788 --> 04:40:01,798
know I hear from startups and businesses
 

15775
04:40:01,798 --> 04:40:03,310
know I hear from startups and businesses
that're like okay like I can take this

15776
04:40:03,310 --> 04:40:03,320
that're like okay like I can take this
 

15777
04:40:03,320 --> 04:40:04,990
that're like okay like I can take this
post training and try to apply it to my

15778
04:40:04,990 --> 04:40:05,000
post training and try to apply it to my
 

15779
04:40:05,000 --> 04:40:07,830
post training and try to apply it to my
domain we talk about verifiers a lot we

15780
04:40:07,830 --> 04:40:07,840
domain we talk about verifiers a lot we
 

15781
04:40:07,840 --> 04:40:09,470
domain we talk about verifiers a lot we
use this idea which is reinforcement

15782
04:40:09,470 --> 04:40:09,480
use this idea which is reinforcement
 

15783
04:40:09,480 --> 04:40:11,948
use this idea which is reinforcement

RL VR kind of similar to R

15786
04:40:14,750 --> 04:40:14,760
RL VR kind of similar to R
 

15787
04:40:14,760 --> 04:40:18,510
RL VR kind of similar to R
lhf and we applied it to math and the

15788
04:40:18,510 --> 04:40:18,520
lhf and we applied it to math and the
 

15789
04:40:18,520 --> 04:40:20,628
lhf and we applied it to math and the
model today which is like we applied it

15790
04:40:20,628 --> 04:40:20,638
model today which is like we applied it
 

15791
04:40:20,638 --> 04:40:23,868
model today which is like we applied it
to the Llama 405b base model from last

15792
04:40:23,868 --> 04:40:23,878
to the Llama 405b base model from last
 

15793
04:40:23,878 --> 04:40:25,830
to the Llama 405b base model from last
year and we have our other stuff we have

15794
04:40:25,830 --> 04:40:25,840
year and we have our other stuff we have
 

15795
04:40:25,840 --> 04:40:28,430
year and we have our other stuff we have
our instruction tuning and preference

15796
04:40:28,430 --> 04:40:28,440
our instruction tuning and preference
 

15797
04:40:28,440 --> 04:40:31,350
our instruction tuning and preference
tuning but the math thing is interesting

15798
04:40:31,350 --> 04:40:31,360
tuning but the math thing is interesting
 

15799
04:40:31,360 --> 04:40:32,948
tuning but the math thing is interesting
which is like it's easier to improve

15800
04:40:32,948 --> 04:40:32,958
which is like it's easier to improve
 

15801
04:40:32,958 --> 04:40:34,868
which is like it's easier to improve
this math benchmark there's a benchmark

15802
04:40:34,868 --> 04:40:34,878
this math benchmark there's a benchmark
 

15803
04:40:34,878 --> 04:40:38,550

we're not we're not Brands brand
strategists and this is something that

15812
04:40:46,390 --> 04:40:46,400
strategists and this is something that
 

15813
04:40:46,400 --> 04:40:48,270
strategists and this is something that
the deeps paper talked about as well is

15814
04:40:48,270 --> 04:40:48,280
the deeps paper talked about as well is
 

15815
04:40:48,280 --> 04:40:50,310
the deeps paper talked about as well is
like at this bigger model it's easier to

15816
04:40:50,310 --> 04:40:50,320
like at this bigger model it's easier to
 

15817
04:40:50,320 --> 04:40:52,230
like at this bigger model it's easier to
elicit powerful capabilities with this

15818
04:40:52,230 --> 04:40:52,240
elicit powerful capabilities with this
 

15819
04:40:52,240 --> 04:40:54,550
elicit powerful capabilities with this
RL training and then they distill it

15820
04:40:54,550 --> 04:40:54,560
RL training and then they distill it
 

15821
04:40:54,560 --> 04:40:56,110
RL training and then they distill it
down from that big model to the small

15822
04:40:56,110 --> 04:40:56,120
down from that big model to the small
 

15823
04:40:56,120 --> 04:40:57,868
down from that big model to the small
model and this model we released today

15824
04:40:57,868 --> 04:40:57,878
model and this model we released today
 

15825
04:40:57,878 --> 04:41:01,230
model and this model we released today
we saw the same thing is we're at ai2 we

15826
04:41:01,230 --> 04:41:01,240
we saw the same thing is we're at ai2 we
 

15827
04:41:01,240 --> 04:41:02,550
we saw the same thing is we're at ai2 we
don't have a ton of compute we can't

15828
04:41:02,550 --> 04:41:02,560
don't have a ton of compute we can't
 

15829
04:41:02,560 --> 04:41:04,430
don't have a ton of compute we can't
train 405b models all the time so we

15830
04:41:04,430 --> 04:41:04,440
train 405b models all the time so we
 

15831
04:41:04,440 --> 04:41:06,470
train 405b models all the time so we
just did a few runs and they tend to

15832
04:41:06,470 --> 04:41:06,480
just did a few runs and they tend to
 

15833
04:41:06,480 --> 04:41:09,070
just did a few runs and they tend to
work and it's like it just shows that

15834
04:41:09,070 --> 04:41:09,080
work and it's like it just shows that
 

15835
04:41:09,080 --> 04:41:11,670
work and it's like it just shows that
there's a lot of room for people to play

15836
04:41:11,670 --> 04:41:11,680
there's a lot of room for people to play
 

15837
04:41:11,680 --> 04:41:13,270
there's a lot of room for people to play
in these things and and they crushed

15838
04:41:13,270 --> 04:41:13,280
in these things and and they crushed
 

15839
04:41:13,280 --> 04:41:15,670
in these things and and they crushed
llama's actual release right like the

15840
04:41:15,670 --> 04:41:15,680
llama's actual release right like the
 

15841
04:41:15,680 --> 04:41:17,390
llama's actual release right like the
they're way better than it yeah so our

15842
04:41:17,390 --> 04:41:17,400
they're way better than it yeah so our
 

15843
04:41:17,400 --> 04:41:19,190
they're way better than it yeah so our
Val numbers I mean we have extra months

15844
04:41:19,190 --> 04:41:19,200
Val numbers I mean we have extra months
 

15845
04:41:19,200 --> 04:41:20,628
Val numbers I mean we have extra months
in this but our Val numbers are like

15846
04:41:20,628 --> 04:41:20,638
in this but our Val numbers are like
 

15847
04:41:20,638 --> 04:41:23,110
in this but our Val numbers are like
much better than the Llama instruct

15848
04:41:23,110 --> 04:41:23,120
much better than the Llama instruct
 

15849
04:41:23,120 --> 04:41:24,628
much better than the Llama instruct
model that they released and you also

15850
04:41:24,628 --> 04:41:24,638
model that they released and you also
 

15851
04:41:24,638 --> 04:41:26,910
model that they released and you also
said better than deep seek V3 yeah on

15852
04:41:26,910 --> 04:41:26,920
said better than deep seek V3 yeah on
 

15853
04:41:26,920 --> 04:41:30,430
said better than deep seek V3 yeah on
our Val Benchmark the most deep seek V3

15854
04:41:30,430 --> 04:41:30,440
our Val Benchmark the most deep seek V3
 

15855
04:41:30,440 --> 04:41:31,910
our Val Benchmark the most deep seek V3
is really similar we have a safety

15856
04:41:31,910 --> 04:41:31,920
is really similar we have a safety
 

15857
04:41:31,920 --> 04:41:34,190
is really similar we have a safety
Benchmark to understand if it will say

15858
04:41:34,190 --> 04:41:34,200
Benchmark to understand if it will say
 

15859
04:41:34,200 --> 04:41:35,510
Benchmark to understand if it will say
harmful things and things like that and

15860
04:41:35,510 --> 04:41:35,520
harmful things and things like that and
 

15861
04:41:35,520 --> 04:41:37,190
harmful things and things like that and
that's what draws down most of the way

15862
04:41:37,190 --> 04:41:37,200
that's what draws down most of the way
 

15863
04:41:37,200 --> 04:41:38,788
that's what draws down most of the way
it's still it's like an amalgamation of

15864
04:41:38,788 --> 04:41:38,798
it's still it's like an amalgamation of
 

15865
04:41:38,798 --> 04:41:40,230
it's still it's like an amalgamation of
multiple benchmarks or what do you mean

15866
04:41:40,230 --> 04:41:40,240
multiple benchmarks or what do you mean
 

15867
04:41:40,240 --> 04:41:42,070
multiple benchmarks or what do you mean
yeah so we have a 10 this is like this

15868
04:41:42,070 --> 04:41:42,080
yeah so we have a 10 this is like this
 

15869
04:41:42,080 --> 04:41:43,510
yeah so we have a 10 this is like this
is standard practice in post training is

15870
04:41:43,510 --> 04:41:43,520
is standard practice in post training is
 

15871
04:41:43,520 --> 04:41:44,990
is standard practice in post training is
you choose your evaluations you care

15872
04:41:44,990 --> 04:41:45,000
you choose your evaluations you care
 

15873
04:41:45,000 --> 04:41:47,310
you choose your evaluations you care
about in academics and smaller Labs

15874
04:41:47,310 --> 04:41:47,320
about in academics and smaller Labs
 

15875
04:41:47,320 --> 04:41:49,070
about in academics and smaller Labs
you'll have fewer evaluations in

15876
04:41:49,070 --> 04:41:49,080
you'll have fewer evaluations in
 

15877
04:41:49,080 --> 04:41:50,430
you'll have fewer evaluations in
companies you'll have a really one

15878
04:41:50,430 --> 04:41:50,440
companies you'll have a really one
 

15879
04:41:50,440 --> 04:41:52,070
companies you'll have a really one
domain that you really care about in

15880
04:41:52,070 --> 04:41:52,080
domain that you really care about in
 

15881
04:41:52,080 --> 04:41:54,150
domain that you really care about in
Frontier Labs you'll have tens to 20s to

15882
04:41:54,150 --> 04:41:54,160
Frontier Labs you'll have tens to 20s to
 

15883
04:41:54,160 --> 04:41:55,788
Frontier Labs you'll have tens to 20s to
maybe even like a 100 valuations of

15884
04:41:55,788 --> 04:41:55,798
maybe even like a 100 valuations of
 

15885
04:41:55,798 --> 04:41:57,430
maybe even like a 100 valuations of
specific things so we choose a

16038
04:44:27,470 --> 04:44:27,480
I at this point I can't pull them
 

16039
04:44:27,480 --> 04:44:30,190
I at this point I can't pull them
off competitor it used to be military

16040
04:44:30,190 --> 04:44:30,200
off competitor it used to be military
 

16041
04:44:30,200 --> 04:44:31,868
off competitor it used to be military
use was one and they removed that for

16042
04:44:31,868 --> 04:44:31,878
use was one and they removed that for
 

16043
04:44:31,878 --> 04:44:35,868
use was one and they removed that for
scale it'll be like like cam like child

16044
04:44:35,868 --> 04:44:35,878
scale it'll be like like cam like child
 

16045
04:44:35,878 --> 04:44:38,310
scale it'll be like like cam like child
abuse material like that's the type of

16046
04:44:38,310 --> 04:44:38,320
abuse material like that's the type of
 

16047
04:44:38,320 --> 04:44:40,230
abuse material like that's the type of
thing that is forbidden there but that's

16048
04:44:40,230 --> 04:44:40,240
thing that is forbidden there but that's
 

16049
04:44:40,240 --> 04:44:42,110
thing that is forbidden there but that's
enough from an open source background to

16050
04:44:42,110 --> 04:44:42,120
enough from an open source background to
 

16051
04:44:42,120 --> 04:44:43,708
enough from an open source background to
say it's not open source license and

16052
04:44:43,708 --> 04:44:43,718
say it's not open source license and
 

16053
04:44:43,718 --> 04:44:45,708
say it's not open source license and
also the Llama license has this horrible

16054
04:44:45,708 --> 04:44:45,718
also the Llama license has this horrible
 

16055
04:44:45,718 --> 04:44:47,868
also the Llama license has this horrible
thing where you have to name your model

16056
04:44:47,868 --> 04:44:47,878
thing where you have to name your model
 

16057
04:44:47,878 --> 04:44:50,948
thing where you have to name your model
llama if you touch it to the Llama model

16058
04:44:50,948 --> 04:44:50,958
llama if you touch it to the Llama model
 

16059
04:44:50,958 --> 04:44:52,470
llama if you touch it to the Llama model
so it's like the branding thing so if a

16060
04:44:52,470 --> 04:44:52,480
so it's like the branding thing so if a
 

16061
04:44:52,480 --> 04:44:54,310
so it's like the branding thing so if a
company uses llama technically the

16062
04:44:54,310 --> 04:44:54,320
company uses llama technically the
 

16063
04:44:54,320 --> 04:44:55,708
company uses llama technically the

16064
04:44:55,708 --> 04:44:55,718
license says that they should say built
 

16065
04:44:55,718 --> 04:44:56,830

with llama at the bottom of their

16066
04:44:56,830 --> 04:44:56,840
with llama at the bottom of their
 

16067
04:44:56,840 --> 04:44:58,830
with llama at the bottom of their
application and from like a marketing

16068
04:44:58,830 --> 04:44:58,840
application and from like a marketing
 

16069
04:44:58,840 --> 04:45:00,230
application and from like a marketing
perspective that just that just hurts

16070
04:45:00,230 --> 04:45:00,240
perspective that just that just hurts
 

16071
04:45:00,240 --> 04:45:01,470
perspective that just that just hurts
like I I could suck it up as a

16072
04:45:01,470 --> 04:45:01,480
like I I could suck it up as a
 

16073
04:45:01,480 --> 04:45:03,150
like I I could suck it up as a
researcher I'm like oh it's fine like it

16074
04:45:03,150 --> 04:45:03,160
researcher I'm like oh it's fine like it
 

16075
04:45:03,160 --> 04:45:05,590

says llama Dash on all of our on all of

16076
04:45:05,590 --> 04:45:05,600
says llama Dash on all of our on all of
 

16077
04:45:05,600 --> 04:45:07,390

our materials for this release but this

16078
04:45:07,390 --> 04:45:07,400
our materials for this release but this
 

16079
04:45:07,400 --> 04:45:09,150
our materials for this release but this
is why we need truly open models which

16080
04:45:09,150 --> 04:45:09,160
is why we need truly open models which
 

16081
04:45:09,160 --> 04:45:12,230
is why we need truly open models which
is uh we don't know deep r1's data wait

16082
04:45:12,230 --> 04:45:12,240
is uh we don't know deep r1's data wait
 

16083
04:45:12,240 --> 04:45:13,910
is uh we don't know deep r1's data wait
so you're saying I can't make a you know

16084
04:45:13,910 --> 04:45:13,920
so you're saying I can't make a you know
 

16085
04:45:13,920 --> 04:45:15,670
so you're saying I can't make a you know
cheap copy of llama and pretend it's

16086
04:45:15,670 --> 04:45:15,680
cheap copy of llama and pretend it's
 

16087
04:45:15,680 --> 04:45:17,070
cheap copy of llama and pretend it's
mine but I can do this with the Chinese

16088
04:45:17,070 --> 04:45:17,080
mine but I can do this with the Chinese
 

16089
04:45:17,080 --> 04:45:19,350
mine but I can do this with the Chinese
model yeah hell

16090
04:45:19,350 --> 04:45:19,360
model yeah hell
 

16091
04:45:19,360 --> 04:45:21,948
model yeah hell
yeah that's that's what I'm saying and

16092
04:45:21,948 --> 04:45:21,958
yeah that's that's what I'm saying and
 

16093
04:45:21,958 --> 04:45:24,310
yeah that's that's what I'm saying and
and that's why it's like we want this

16094
04:45:24,310 --> 04:45:24,320
and that's why it's like we want this
 

16095
04:45:24,320 --> 04:45:26,510
and that's why it's like we want this
whole open language models thing Theo

16096
04:45:26,510 --> 04:45:26,520
whole open language models thing Theo
 

16097
04:45:26,520 --> 04:45:28,910
whole open language models thing Theo
thing is to try to keep the model where

16098
04:45:28,910 --> 04:45:28,920
thing is to try to keep the model where
 

16099
04:45:28,920 --> 04:45:30,590
thing is to try to keep the model where
everything is open with the data as

16100
04:45:30,590 --> 04:45:30,600
everything is open with the data as
 

16101
04:45:30,600 --> 04:45:32,070
everything is open with the data as
close to the frontier as possible so

16102
04:45:32,070 --> 04:45:32,080
close to the frontier as possible so
 

16103
04:45:32,080 --> 04:45:33,270
close to the frontier as possible so
we're compute constrained we're

16104
04:45:33,270 --> 04:45:33,280
we're compute constrained we're
 

16105
04:45:33,280 --> 04:45:35,750
we're compute constrained we're
Personnel constrained we're we we rely

16106
04:45:35,750 --> 04:45:35,760
Personnel constrained we're we we rely
 

16107
04:45:35,760 --> 04:45:37,708
Personnel constrained we're we we rely
on getting insights from people like

16108
04:45:37,708 --> 04:45:37,718
on getting insights from people like
 

16109
04:45:37,718 --> 04:45:39,430
on getting insights from people like
John Schulman tells us to do RL on

16110
04:45:39,430 --> 04:45:39,440
John Schulman tells us to do RL on
 

16111
04:45:39,440 --> 04:45:41,670
John Schulman tells us to do RL on
outputs like we can make these big jumps

16112
04:45:41,670 --> 04:45:41,680
outputs like we can make these big jumps
 

16113
04:45:41,680 --> 04:45:43,550
outputs like we can make these big jumps
but it just takes a long time to push

16114
04:45:43,550 --> 04:45:43,560
but it just takes a long time to push
 

16115
04:45:43,560 --> 04:45:45,628
but it just takes a long time to push
the frontier of Open Source and

16116
04:45:45,628 --> 04:45:45,638
the frontier of Open Source and
 

16117
04:45:45,638 --> 04:45:47,788
the frontier of Open Source and
fundamentally I would say that that's

16118
04:45:47,788 --> 04:45:47,798
fundamentally I would say that that's
 

16119
04:45:47,798 --> 04:45:49,788
fundamentally I would say that that's
because open source AI does not have the

16120
04:45:49,788 --> 04:45:49,798
because open source AI does not have the
 

16121
04:45:49,798 --> 04:45:51,470
because open source AI does not have the
same feedback loops as open source

16122
04:45:51,470 --> 04:45:51,480
same feedback loops as open source
 

16123
04:45:51,480 --> 04:45:52,830
same feedback loops as open source
software we talked about open source

16124
04:45:52,830 --> 04:45:52,840
software we talked about open source
 

16125
04:45:52,840 --> 04:45:55,190
software we talked about open source
software for security also is just

16126
04:45:55,190 --> 04:45:55,200
software for security also is just
 

16127
04:45:55,200 --> 04:45:56,990
software for security also is just
because you build something once and you

16128
04:45:56,990 --> 04:45:57,000
because you build something once and you
 

16129
04:45:57,000 --> 04:45:58,708
because you build something once and you
can reuse it if you go into a new

16130
04:45:58,708 --> 04:45:58,718
can reuse it if you go into a new
 

16131
04:45:58,718 --> 04:46:00,910
can reuse it if you go into a new
company there's so many benefits but if

16132
04:46:00,910 --> 04:46:00,920
company there's so many benefits but if
 

16133
04:46:00,920 --> 04:46:02,830
company there's so many benefits but if
you open source a language model you

16134
04:46:02,830 --> 04:46:02,840
you open source a language model you
 

16135
04:46:02,840 --> 04:46:04,270
you open source a language model you
have you have this data sitting around

16136
04:46:04,270 --> 04:46:04,280
have you have this data sitting around
 

16137
04:46:04,280 --> 04:46:05,948
have you have this data sitting around
you have this training code it's not

16138
04:46:05,948 --> 04:46:05,958
you have this training code it's not
 

16139
04:46:05,958 --> 04:46:08,150
you have this training code it's not
like that easy for someone to come and

16140
04:46:08,150 --> 04:46:08,160
like that easy for someone to come and
 

16141
04:46:08,160 --> 04:46:09,430
like that easy for someone to come and
build on and improve because you need to

16142
04:46:09,430 --> 04:46:09,440
build on and improve because you need to
 

16143
04:46:09,440 --> 04:46:11,110
build on and improve because you need to
spend a lot on compute you need to have

16144
04:46:11,110 --> 04:46:11,120
spend a lot on compute you need to have
 

16145
04:46:11,120 --> 04:46:13,948
spend a lot on compute you need to have
expertise so until there are feedback

16146
04:46:13,948 --> 04:46:13,958
expertise so until there are feedback
 

16147
04:46:13,958 --> 04:46:15,948
expertise so until there are feedback
loops of Open Source AI it seems like

16148
04:46:15,948 --> 04:46:15,958
loops of Open Source AI it seems like
 

16149
04:46:15,958 --> 04:46:18,190
loops of Open Source AI it seems like
mostly an IDE ideological Mission like

16150
04:46:18,190 --> 04:46:18,200
mostly an IDE ideological Mission like
 

16151
04:46:18,200 --> 04:46:19,430
mostly an IDE ideological Mission like
people like Mark Zuckerberg which is

16152
04:46:19,430 --> 04:46:19,440
people like Mark Zuckerberg which is
 

16153
04:46:19,440 --> 04:46:22,350
people like Mark Zuckerberg which is
like America needs this and I agree with

16154
04:46:22,350 --> 04:46:22,360
like America needs this and I agree with
 

16155
04:46:22,360 --> 04:46:25,230
like America needs this and I agree with
him but in the time where the motivation

16156
04:46:25,230 --> 04:46:25,240
him but in the time where the motivation
 

16157
04:46:25,240 --> 04:46:27,430
him but in the time where the motivation
ideologically is high we need to

16158
04:46:27,430 --> 04:46:27,440
ideologically is high we need to
 

16159
04:46:27,440 --> 04:46:29,230
ideologically is high we need to
capitalize and build this ecosystem

16160
04:46:29,230 --> 04:46:29,240
capitalize and build this ecosystem
 

16161
04:46:29,240 --> 04:46:31,390
capitalize and build this ecosystem
around what benefits do you get from

16162
04:46:31,390 --> 04:46:31,400
around what benefits do you get from
 

16163
04:46:31,400 --> 04:46:33,510
around what benefits do you get from
seeing the language model data and

16164
04:46:33,510 --> 04:46:33,520
seeing the language model data and
 

16165
04:46:33,520 --> 04:46:35,430
seeing the language model data and
there's not a lot about there we're

16166
04:46:35,430 --> 04:46:35,440
there's not a lot about there we're
 

16167
04:46:35,440 --> 04:46:36,868
there's not a lot about there we're
going to try to launch a demo soon where

16168
04:46:36,868 --> 04:46:36,878
going to try to launch a demo soon where
 

16169
04:46:36,878 --> 04:46:39,548
going to try to launch a demo soon where
you can look at AO model and a query and

16170
04:46:39,548 --> 04:46:39,558
you can look at AO model and a query and
 

16171
04:46:39,558 --> 04:46:41,750
you can look at AO model and a query and
see what pre-training data similar to it

16172
04:46:41,750 --> 04:46:41,760
see what pre-training data similar to it
 

16173
04:46:41,760 --> 04:46:43,910
see what pre-training data similar to it
which was like legally risky and

16174
04:46:43,910 --> 04:46:43,920
which was like legally risky and
 

16175
04:46:43,920 --> 04:46:46,270
which was like legally risky and
complicated but it's like what does it

16176
04:46:46,270 --> 04:46:46,280
complicated but it's like what does it
 

16177
04:46:46,280 --> 04:46:48,310
complicated but it's like what does it
mean to see the data that the AI was

16178
04:46:48,310 --> 04:46:48,320
mean to see the data that the AI was
 

16179
04:46:48,320 --> 04:46:50,230
mean to see the data that the AI was
trained on it's hard to parse it's

16180
04:46:50,230 --> 04:46:50,240
trained on it's hard to parse it's
 

16181
04:46:50,240 --> 04:46:52,390
trained on it's hard to parse it's
terabytes of files it's like I I I don't

16182
04:46:52,390 --> 04:46:52,400
terabytes of files it's like I I I don't
 

16183
04:46:52,400 --> 04:46:54,548
terabytes of files it's like I I I don't
know what I'm going to find in there but

16184
04:46:54,548 --> 04:46:54,558
know what I'm going to find in there but
 

16185
04:46:54,558 --> 04:46:55,750
know what I'm going to find in there but
that's what that's what we need to do as

16186
04:46:55,750 --> 04:46:55,760
that's what that's what we need to do as
 

16187
04:46:55,760 --> 04:46:58,350
that's what that's what we need to do as
an ecosystem if people want open source

04:46:58,350 --> 04:46:58,360
an ecosystem if people want open source
 

16189

an ecosystem if people want open source
AI to be financially useful we didn't

AI to be financially useful we didn't
 

16191
04:47:01,680 --> 04:47:02,990
AI to be financially useful we didn't
really talk about Stargate I would love

and uh does Sam have the
 

16211
04:47:22,440 --> 04:47:26,110
and uh does Sam have the
money yeah so I think uh Stargate is a

16212
04:47:26,110 --> 04:47:26,120
money yeah so I think uh Stargate is a
 

16213
04:47:26,120 --> 04:47:27,910
money yeah so I think uh Stargate is a
opaque thing it definitely doesn't have

16214
04:47:27,910 --> 04:47:27,920
opaque thing it definitely doesn't have

$500 billion doesn't even have hundred
 

16217
04:47:30,000 --> 04:47:31,390
$500 billion doesn't even have hundred
billion do right so what they announced

billion do right so what they announced
is this $500 billion number Larry

16220
04:47:33,708 --> 04:47:33,718
is this $500 billion number Larry
 

16221

executive actions that like do
 

16229
04:47:43,040 --> 04:47:44,670
executive actions that like do
significantly improve the ability for

16230
04:47:44,670 --> 04:47:44,680
significantly improve the ability for
 

16231
04:47:44,680 --> 04:47:47,708
significantly improve the ability for
this to be built faster um you know one

16232
04:47:47,708 --> 04:47:47,718
this to be built faster um you know one
 

16233
04:47:47,718 --> 04:47:49,190
this to be built faster um you know one
of the executive actions he did is on

16234
04:47:49,190 --> 04:47:49,200
of the executive actions he did is on
 

16235
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:50,510
of the executive actions he did is on
Federal Land you can just basically

16236
04:47:50,510 --> 04:47:50,520
Federal Land you can just basically
 

16237
04:47:50,520 --> 04:47:53,030
Federal Land you can just basically
build data centers in power you know

16238
04:47:53,030 --> 04:47:53,040
build data centers in power you know
 

16239
04:47:53,040 --> 04:47:54,830
build data centers in power you know
like pretty much like that uh and then

16240
04:47:54,830 --> 04:47:54,840
like pretty much like that uh and then
 

16241
04:47:54,840 --> 04:47:56,670
like pretty much like that uh and then
the permitting process is basically gone

16242
04:47:56,670 --> 04:47:56,680
the permitting process is basically gone
 

16243
04:47:56,680 --> 04:47:58,788
the permitting process is basically gone
or you file after the fact so like one

16244
04:47:58,788 --> 04:47:58,798
or you file after the fact so like one
 

16245
04:47:58,798 --> 04:48:00,430
or you file after the fact so like one
of the again like I had a skitso take

16246
04:48:00,430 --> 04:48:00,440
of the again like I had a skitso take
 

16247
04:48:00,440 --> 04:48:01,750
of the again like I had a skitso take
earlier another skitso take if you've

16248
04:48:01,750 --> 04:48:01,760
earlier another skitso take if you've
 

16249
04:48:01,760 --> 04:48:03,430
earlier another skitso take if you've
ever been to the precidio in San

16250
04:48:03,430 --> 04:48:03,440
ever been to the precidio in San
 

16251
04:48:03,440 --> 04:48:06,070
ever been to the precidio in San
Francisco beautiful area you could build

16252
04:48:06,070 --> 04:48:06,080
Francisco beautiful area you could build
 

16253
04:48:06,080 --> 04:48:07,510
Francisco beautiful area you could build
a power plant in a data center there if

16254
04:48:07,510 --> 04:48:07,520
a power plant in a data center there if
 

16255
04:48:07,520 --> 04:48:09,590
a power plant in a data center there if
you wanted to because it is federal land

16256
04:48:09,590 --> 04:48:09,600
you wanted to because it is federal land
 

16257
04:48:09,600 --> 04:48:11,390
you wanted to because it is federal land
it used to be a military base

16258
04:48:11,390 --> 04:48:11,400
it used to be a military base
 

16259
04:48:11,400 --> 04:48:13,310
it used to be a military base
but you know obviously this would like

16260
04:48:13,310 --> 04:48:13,320
but you know obviously this would like
 

16261
04:48:13,320 --> 04:48:15,788
but you know obviously this would like
piss people off you know it's a good bit

16262
04:48:15,788 --> 04:48:15,798
piss people off you know it's a good bit
 

16263
04:48:15,798 --> 04:48:18,548
piss people off you know it's a good bit
anyways Trump trump has made it much

16264
04:48:18,548 --> 04:48:18,558
anyways Trump trump has made it much
 

16265
04:48:18,558 --> 04:48:21,150
anyways Trump trump has made it much
easier to do this right generally Texas

16266
04:48:21,150 --> 04:48:21,160
easier to do this right generally Texas
 

16267
04:48:21,160 --> 04:48:23,070
easier to do this right generally Texas
has the only unregulated Grid in the in

16268
04:48:23,070 --> 04:48:23,080
has the only unregulated Grid in the in
 

16269
04:48:23,080 --> 04:48:25,548
has the only unregulated Grid in the in
the nation as well let's go Texas um and

16270
04:48:25,548 --> 04:48:25,558
the nation as well let's go Texas um and
 

16271
04:48:25,558 --> 04:48:28,510
the nation as well let's go Texas um and
so you know therefore like OT enables

16272
04:48:28,510 --> 04:48:28,520
so you know therefore like OT enables
 

16273
04:48:28,520 --> 04:48:30,110
so you know therefore like OT enables
people to build faster as well in

16274
04:48:30,110 --> 04:48:30,120
people to build faster as well in
 

16275
04:48:30,120 --> 04:48:31,590
people to build faster as well in
addition the Federal Regulations are

16276
04:48:31,590 --> 04:48:31,600
addition the Federal Regulations are
 

16277
04:48:31,600 --> 04:48:34,948
addition the Federal Regulations are
coming down um and so Stargate is

16278
04:48:34,948 --> 04:48:34,958
coming down um and so Stargate is
 

16279
04:48:34,958 --> 04:48:36,270
coming down um and so Stargate is
predicated and this is why that whole

16280
04:48:36,270 --> 04:48:36,280
predicated and this is why that whole
 

16281
04:48:36,280 --> 04:48:38,350
predicated and this is why that whole
show happened now how they came up with

16282
04:48:38,350 --> 04:48:38,360
show happened now how they came up with
 

16283
04:48:38,360 --> 04:48:40,948
show happened now how they came up with
a $500 billion number is beyond me how

16284
04:48:40,948 --> 04:48:40,958
a $500 billion number is beyond me how
 

16285
04:48:40,958 --> 04:48:42,030
a $500 billion number is beyond me how
they came up with a hundred billion

16286
04:48:42,030 --> 04:48:42,040
they came up with a hundred billion
 

16287
04:48:42,040 --> 04:48:44,510
they came up with a hundred billion
dollar number makes sense to some extent

16288
04:48:44,510 --> 04:48:44,520
dollar number makes sense to some extent
 

16289
04:48:44,520 --> 04:48:46,788
dollar number makes sense to some extent
right and um there's actually a good

16290
04:48:46,788 --> 04:48:46,798
right and um there's actually a good
 

16291
04:48:46,798 --> 04:48:48,830
right and um there's actually a good
table in here that I would like to show

16292
04:48:48,830 --> 04:48:48,840
table in here that I would like to show
 

16293
04:48:48,840 --> 04:48:50,788
table in here that I would like to show
um in the in that uh Stargate piece that

16294
04:48:50,788 --> 04:48:50,798
um in the in that uh Stargate piece that
 

16295
04:48:50,798 --> 04:48:53,670
um in the in that uh Stargate piece that
I had

16296
04:48:53,670 --> 04:48:53,680
I had
 

16297
04:48:53,680 --> 04:48:56,030
I had
um it's it's the it's the most recent

16298
04:48:56,030 --> 04:48:56,040
um it's it's the it's the most recent
 

16299
04:48:56,040 --> 04:48:59,190
um it's it's the it's the most recent
one yeah so so anyways Stargate um you

16300
04:48:59,190 --> 04:48:59,200
one yeah so so anyways Stargate um you
 

16301
04:48:59,200 --> 04:49:00,990
one yeah so so anyways Stargate um you
know it's it's basically right like

16302
04:49:00,990 --> 04:49:01,000
know it's it's basically right like
 

16303
04:49:01,000 --> 04:49:04,430
know it's it's basically right like
there is uh it's it's a table about cost

16304
04:49:04,430 --> 04:49:04,440
there is uh it's it's a table about cost
 

16305
04:49:04,440 --> 04:49:08,390
there is uh it's it's a table about cost
um there you passed it already it's that

16306
04:49:08,390 --> 04:49:08,400
um there you passed it already it's that
 

16307
04:49:08,400 --> 04:49:11,190
um there you passed it already it's that
one so this table is kind of explaining

16308
04:49:11,190 --> 04:49:11,200
one so this table is kind of explaining
 

16309
04:49:11,200 --> 04:49:13,230
one so this table is kind of explaining
what happens right so Stargate is in

16310
04:49:13,230 --> 04:49:13,240
what happens right so Stargate is in
 

16311
04:49:13,240 --> 04:49:15,110
what happens right so Stargate is in
abalene Texas the first hundred billion

16312
04:49:15,110 --> 04:49:15,120
abalene Texas the first hundred billion
 

16313
04:49:15,120 --> 04:49:18,110
abalene Texas the first hundred billion
dollar of it uh that site is 2.2 GW of

16314
04:49:18,110 --> 04:49:18,120
dollar of it uh that site is 2.2 GW of
 

16315
04:49:18,120 --> 04:49:21,350
dollar of it uh that site is 2.2 GW of
power in about 1.8 gwatt of power uh

16316
04:49:21,350 --> 04:49:21,360
power in about 1.8 gwatt of power uh
 

16317
04:49:21,360 --> 04:49:25,310
power in about 1.8 gwatt of power uh
consumed right um per GPU they they they

16318
04:49:25,310 --> 04:49:25,320
consumed right um per GPU they they they
 

16319
04:49:25,320 --> 04:49:27,708
consumed right um per GPU they they they
have like roughly uh Oracle is already

16320
04:49:27,708 --> 04:49:27,718
have like roughly uh Oracle is already
 

16321
04:49:27,718 --> 04:49:29,868
have like roughly uh Oracle is already
building the first part of of this

16322
04:49:29,868 --> 04:49:29,878
building the first part of of this
 

16323
04:49:29,878 --> 04:49:31,708
building the first part of of this
before Stargate came about to be clear

16324
04:49:31,708 --> 04:49:31,718
before Stargate came about to be clear
 

16325
04:49:31,718 --> 04:49:32,788
before Stargate came about to be clear
they've been building it for a year they

16326
04:49:32,788 --> 04:49:32,798
they've been building it for a year they
 

16327
04:49:32,798 --> 04:49:35,270
they've been building it for a year they
tried to rent it to Elon in fact right

16328
04:49:35,270 --> 04:49:35,280
tried to rent it to Elon in fact right
 

16329
04:49:35,280 --> 04:49:36,750
tried to rent it to Elon in fact right
um but Elon was like it's too slow I

16330
04:49:36,750 --> 04:49:36,760
um but Elon was like it's too slow I
 

16331
04:49:36,760 --> 04:49:37,990
um but Elon was like it's too slow I
need it faster so then he went and did

16332
04:49:37,990 --> 04:49:38,000
need it faster so then he went and did
 

16333
04:49:38,000 --> 04:49:40,830
need it faster so then he went and did
his Memphis thing um and so opening was

16334
04:49:40,830 --> 04:49:40,840
his Memphis thing um and so opening was
 

16335
04:49:40,840 --> 04:49:42,628
his Memphis thing um and so opening was
able to get it uh with this like weird

16336
04:49:42,628 --> 04:49:42,638
able to get it uh with this like weird
 

16337
04:49:42,638 --> 04:49:44,548

there is the number of hundred billion
 

16401
04:50:52,360 --> 04:50:54,390
there is the number of hundred billion
dollar that they say is for phase one uh

regulation will go down and this is the
 

16577
04:53:44,480 --> 04:53:46,868
regulation will go down and this is the
era of building so if you're a builder

16578
04:53:46,868 --> 04:53:46,878
era of building so if you're a builder
 

16579
04:53:46,878 --> 04:53:48,150
era of building so if you're a builder
you want to create stuff you want to

multi- gigawatts but that is like at a

16594
04:54:00,310 --> 04:54:00,320
multi- gigawatts but that is like at a
 

16595
04:54:00,320 --> 04:54:02,230
multi- gigawatts but that is like at a
level that's not quite maybe Executives

16596
04:54:02,230 --> 04:54:02,240
level that's not quite maybe Executives

it could spur like another like an even
 

16603
04:54:08,600 --> 04:54:10,430
it could spur like another like an even
faster arms race right CU there's

16604
04:54:10,430 --> 04:54:10,440
faster arms race right CU there's
 

16605
04:54:10,440 --> 04:54:12,270
faster arms race right CU there's
already at arms race but like this this

16606
04:54:12,270 --> 04:54:12,280
already at arms race but like this this

educate me a little bit about the speed

16700
04:55:49,708 --> 04:55:49,718
educate me a little bit about the speed
 

16701
04:55:49,718 --> 04:55:52,150
educate me a little bit about the speed
of things so the speed of memory versus

speed of fiber between data centers are
 

16707
04:55:56,080 --> 04:55:57,628
speed of fiber between data centers are
is are these like orders of magnitude

image that people like to have is like

16726
04:56:15,430 --> 04:56:15,440
image that people like to have is like
 

16727
04:56:15,440 --> 04:56:17,788
image that people like to have is like
this hierarchy of memory so on chip is

16728
04:56:17,788 --> 04:56:17,798
this hierarchy of memory so on chip is
 

16729
04:56:17,798 --> 04:56:19,670
this hierarchy of memory so on chip is
really close localized within the chip

16730
04:56:19,670 --> 04:56:19,680
really close localized within the chip
 

16731
04:56:19,680 --> 04:56:21,030
really close localized within the chip
right you know there you have registers

16732
04:56:21,030 --> 04:56:21,040
right you know there you have registers
 

16733
04:56:21,040 --> 04:56:22,470
right you know there you have registers
right and those are shared between some

16734
04:56:22,470 --> 04:56:22,480
right and those are shared between some
 

16735
04:56:22,480 --> 04:56:23,990
right and those are shared between some
compute elements and then you'll have

16736
04:56:23,990 --> 04:56:24,000
compute elements and then you'll have
 

16737
04:56:24,000 --> 04:56:25,310
compute elements and then you'll have
caches which are shared between more

16738
04:56:25,310 --> 04:56:25,320
caches which are shared between more
 

16739
04:56:25,320 --> 04:56:26,470
caches which are shared between more
compute elements then you have like

16740
04:56:26,470 --> 04:56:26,480
compute elements then you have like
 

16741
04:56:26,480 --> 04:56:29,350
compute elements then you have like
memory right like hbm or Dam like DDR

16742
04:56:29,350 --> 04:56:29,360
memory right like hbm or Dam like DDR
 

16743
04:56:29,360 --> 04:56:30,510
memory right like hbm or Dam like DDR
memory or whatever it is and that's

16744
04:56:30,510 --> 04:56:30,520
memory or whatever it is and that's
 

16745
04:56:30,520 --> 04:56:32,670
memory or whatever it is and that's
shared between the whole chip um and

16746
04:56:32,670 --> 04:56:32,680
shared between the whole chip um and
 

16747
04:56:32,680 --> 04:56:34,390
shared between the whole chip um and
then you can have you know pools of

16748
04:56:34,390 --> 04:56:34,400
then you can have you know pools of
 

16749
04:56:34,400 --> 04:56:35,830
then you can have you know pools of
memory that are shared between many

16750
04:56:35,830 --> 04:56:35,840
memory that are shared between many
 

16751
04:56:35,840 --> 04:56:37,868
memory that are shared between many
chips right um and then storage and it

16752
04:56:37,868 --> 04:56:37,878
chips right um and then storage and it
 

16753
04:56:37,878 --> 04:56:39,750
chips right um and then storage and it
keep you keep zoning out right the

16754
04:56:39,750 --> 04:56:39,760
keep you keep zoning out right the
 

16755
04:56:39,760 --> 04:56:41,628
keep you keep zoning out right the
access latency across data centers

16756
04:56:41,628 --> 04:56:41,638
access latency across data centers
 

16757
04:56:41,638 --> 04:56:43,110
access latency across data centers
across within the data center within a

16758
04:56:43,110 --> 04:56:43,120
across within the data center within a
 

16759
04:56:43,120 --> 04:56:44,990
across within the data center within a
chip is diff so like you're obviously

16760
04:56:44,990 --> 04:56:45,000
chip is diff so like you're obviously
 

16761
04:56:45,000 --> 04:56:46,830
chip is diff so like you're obviously
always you're always going to have

16762
04:56:46,830 --> 04:56:46,840
always you're always going to have
 

16763
04:56:46,840 --> 04:56:49,548
always you're always going to have
different um programming paradigms for

16764
04:56:49,548 --> 04:56:49,558
different um programming paradigms for
 

16765
04:56:49,558 --> 04:56:50,788
different um programming paradigms for
this it's not going to be easy

16766
04:56:50,788 --> 04:56:50,798
this it's not going to be easy
 

16767
04:56:50,798 --> 04:56:51,708
this it's not going to be easy
programming this stuff is going to be

16768
04:56:51,708 --> 04:56:51,718
programming this stuff is going to be
 

16769
04:56:51,718 --> 04:56:54,510
programming this stuff is going to be
hard maybe I can help right um you know

16770
04:56:54,510 --> 04:56:54,520
hard maybe I can help right um you know
 

16771
04:56:54,520 --> 04:56:56,548
hard maybe I can help right um you know
with programming this but the the the

16772
04:56:56,548 --> 04:56:56,558
with programming this but the the the
 

16773
04:56:56,558 --> 04:57:02,868
with programming this but the the the
way to think about it is that like there

16774
04:57:02,868 --> 04:57:02,878

 

16775
04:57:02,878 --> 04:57:06,030

is there there's sort of like the more

16776
04:57:06,030 --> 04:57:06,040
is there there's sort of like the more
 

16777
04:57:06,040 --> 04:57:08,948
is there there's sort of like the more
elements you add to a task you you don't

16778
04:57:08,948 --> 04:57:08,958
elements you add to a task you you don't
 

16779
04:57:08,958 --> 04:57:10,548
elements you add to a task you you don't
gain you don't get strong skills right

16780
04:57:10,548 --> 04:57:10,558
gain you don't get strong skills right
 

16781
04:57:10,558 --> 04:57:11,708
gain you don't get strong skills right
if I double the number of chips I don't

16782
04:57:11,708 --> 04:57:11,718
if I double the number of chips I don't
 

16783
04:57:11,718 --> 04:57:13,110
if I double the number of chips I don't
get 2x the performance right this is

16784
04:57:13,110 --> 04:57:13,120

04:59:40,958 --> 04:59:42,150
that's like we're the ones that it's
like we're going to do it and you can

16938
04:59:42,150 --> 04:59:42,160
like we're going to do it and you can
 

16939
04:59:42,160 --> 04:59:43,270
like we're going to do it and you can
trust us and we're just going to have

16940
04:59:43,270 --> 04:59:43,280
trust us and we're just going to have
 

16941
04:59:43,280 --> 04:59:46,030
trust us and we're just going to have
all the a Ai and it's just like I would

16942
04:59:46,030 --> 04:59:46,040
all the a Ai and it's just like I would
 

16943
04:59:46,040 --> 04:59:48,070
all the a Ai and it's just like I would
like a future where more people have a

16944
04:59:48,070 --> 04:59:48,080
like a future where more people have a
 

16945
04:59:48,080 --> 04:59:50,948
like a future where more people have a
say and what AI is and can understand it

16946
04:59:50,948 --> 04:59:50,958
say and what AI is and can understand it
 

16947
04:59:50,958 --> 04:59:53,470
say and what AI is and can understand it
and that's it's it's a little bit less

16948
04:59:53,470 --> 04:59:53,480
and that's it's it's a little bit less
 

16949
04:59:53,480 --> 04:59:55,110
and that's it's it's a little bit less
fun that it's not a like positive thing

16950
04:59:55,110 --> 04:59:55,120
fun that it's not a like positive thing
 

16951
04:59:55,120 --> 04:59:56,510
fun that it's not a like positive thing
of like this is just all really fun like

16952
04:59:56,510 --> 04:59:56,520
of like this is just all really fun like
 

16953
04:59:56,520 --> 04:59:58,948
of like this is just all really fun like
training models is fun and bring people

16954
04:59:58,948 --> 04:59:58,958
training models is fun and bring people
 

16955
04:59:58,958 --> 05:00:00,830
training models is fun and bring people
in is fun but it's really like AI if it

16956
05:00:00,830 --> 05:00:00,840
in is fun but it's really like AI if it
 

16957
05:00:00,840 --> 05:00:02,230
in is fun but it's really like AI if it
is going to be the most powerful

16958
05:00:02,230 --> 05:00:02,240
is going to be the most powerful
 

16959
05:00:02,240 --> 05:00:04,590
is going to be the most powerful
technology of my lifetime it's like we

16960
05:00:04,590 --> 05:00:04,600
technology of my lifetime it's like we
 

16961
05:00:04,600 --> 05:00:06,910
technology of my lifetime it's like we
need to have a lot of people involved in

16962
05:00:06,910 --> 05:00:06,920
need to have a lot of people involved in
 

16963
05:00:06,920 --> 05:00:10,670
need to have a lot of people involved in
making that and making it making it open

16964
05:00:10,670 --> 05:00:10,680
making that and making it making it open
 

16965
05:00:10,680 --> 05:00:12,590
making that and making it making it open
helps with that as accessible as

16966
05:00:12,590 --> 05:00:12,600
helps with that as accessible as
 

16967
05:00:12,600 --> 05:00:14,948
helps with that as accessible as
possible as open as possible yeah in the

16968
05:00:14,948 --> 05:00:14,958
possible as open as possible yeah in the
 

16969
05:00:14,958 --> 05:00:16,510
possible as open as possible yeah in the
my read of the last few years is that

16970
05:00:16,510 --> 05:00:16,520
my read of the last few years is that
 

16971
05:00:16,520 --> 05:00:18,628
my read of the last few years is that
more openness would help the AI

16972
05:00:18,628 --> 05:00:18,638
more openness would help the AI
 

16973
05:00:18,638 --> 05:00:20,948
more openness would help the AI
ecosystem in terms of having more people

16974
05:00:20,948 --> 05:00:20,958
ecosystem in terms of having more people
 

16975
05:00:20,958 --> 05:00:22,230
ecosystem in terms of having more people
understand what's going on rather that's

16982
05:00:27,390 --> 05:00:27,400
mean that openness will always be the
 

16983
05:00:27,400 --> 05:00:29,830
mean that openness will always be the
answer I think then it will reassess of

05:00:29,830 --> 05:00:29,840
answer I think then it will reassess of
 

16985
05:00:29,840 --> 05:00:31,230
answer I think then it will reassess of

I started with AI of learning to fly a

17046
05:01:47,110 --> 05:01:47,120
I started with AI of learning to fly a

05:01:47,120 --> 05:01:49,470
I started with AI of learning to fly a
silia quad RoR it's like Learn to Fly

17048
05:01:49,470 --> 05:01:49,480
silia quad RoR it's like Learn to Fly
 

17049
05:01:49,480 --> 05:01:51,750
silia quad RoR it's like Learn to Fly
and it just like it learned to fly up it

17050
05:01:51,750 --> 05:01:51,760
and it just like it learned to fly up it
 

17051
05:01:51,760 --> 05:01:53,310
and it just like it learned to fly up it
would hit the ceiling and stop and catch

17052
05:01:53,310 --> 05:01:53,320
would hit the ceiling and stop and catch
 

17053
05:01:53,320 --> 05:01:54,830
would hit the ceiling and stop and catch
it it's like okay that is like really

17054
05:01:54,830 --> 05:01:54,840
it it's like okay that is like really
 

17055
05:01:54,840 --> 05:01:57,110
it it's like okay that is like really
stupid compared to what's going on now

stupid compared to what's going on now
 

17057
05:01:57,120 --> 05:01:59,110
stupid compared to what's going on now
and now you could probably with natural

and now you could probably with natural
 

17059
05:01:59,120 --> 05:02:01,190
and now you could probably with natural
language tell it to learn to fly and

17060
05:02:01,190 --> 05:02:01,200
language tell it to learn to fly and
 

17061
05:02:01,200 --> 05:02:02,548

it's going to generate the control
 

17063
05:02:02,558 --> 05:02:05,070
it's going to generate the control

there's lowlevel blockers like we had to
 

17067
05:02:06,798 --> 05:02:08,910
there's lowlevel blockers like we had to
do some weird stuff for that but you can

17068
05:02:08,910 --> 05:02:08,920
do some weird stuff for that but you can

thousand years humans will definitely be
around in a thousand years I think

17088
05:02:31,310 --> 05:02:31,320
around in a thousand years I think
 

17089
05:02:31,320 --> 05:02:32,750
around in a thousand years I think
there's there's ways that very bad

17090
05:02:32,750 --> 05:02:32,760
there's there's ways that very bad
 

17091
05:02:32,760 --> 05:02:34,230
there's there's ways that very bad
things could happen there'll be way

17092
05:02:34,230 --> 05:02:34,240
things could happen there'll be way
 

17093
05:02:34,240 --> 05:02:36,150
things could happen there'll be way
fewer humans but humans are very good at

17094
05:02:36,150 --> 05:02:36,160
fewer humans but humans are very good at
 

17095
05:02:36,160 --> 05:02:38,470
fewer humans but humans are very good at
surviving there's been a lot of things

17096
05:02:38,470 --> 05:02:38,480
surviving there's been a lot of things
 

17097
05:02:38,480 --> 05:02:41,430
surviving there's been a lot of things
that that is true I don't think they're

17098
05:02:41,430 --> 05:02:41,440
that that is true I don't think they're
 

17099
05:02:41,440 --> 05:02:43,910
that that is true I don't think they're
necessarily we're good at long-term

17100
05:02:43,910 --> 05:02:43,920
necessarily we're good at long-term
 

17101
05:02:43,920 --> 05:02:45,948
necessarily we're good at long-term
credit assignment of risk but when the

17102
05:02:45,948 --> 05:02:45,958
credit assignment of risk but when the
 

17103
05:02:45,958 --> 05:02:48,270
credit assignment of risk but when the
risk becomes immediate we tend to figure

17104
05:02:48,270 --> 05:02:48,280
risk becomes immediate we tend to figure
 

17105
05:02:48,280 --> 05:02:50,708
risk becomes immediate we tend to figure
things out and oh yeah for that reason

17106
05:02:50,708 --> 05:02:50,718
things out and oh yeah for that reason
 

17107
05:02:50,718 --> 05:02:53,350
things out and oh yeah for that reason
I'm like there's physical constraints to

17108
05:02:53,350 --> 05:02:53,360
I'm like there's physical constraints to
 

17109
05:02:53,360 --> 05:02:57,110
I'm like there's physical constraints to
things like AGI hyper like recursive

17110
05:02:57,110 --> 05:02:57,120
things like AGI hyper like recursive
 

17111
05:02:57,120 --> 05:02:59,590
things like AGI hyper like recursive
Improvement to kill us all type stuff

17112
05:02:59,590 --> 05:02:59,600
Improvement to kill us all type stuff
 

17113
05:02:59,600 --> 05:03:01,510
Improvement to kill us all type stuff
I'm for the physical reasons and for how

17114
05:03:01,510 --> 05:03:01,520
I'm for the physical reasons and for how
 

17115
05:03:01,520 --> 05:03:02,910
I'm for the physical reasons and for how
humans have figured things out before

17116
05:03:02,910 --> 05:03:02,920
humans have figured things out before
 

17117
05:03:02,920 --> 05:03:05,590
humans have figured things out before
I'm not too worried about an AI takeover

17118
05:03:05,590 --> 05:03:05,600
I'm not too worried about an AI takeover
 

17119
05:03:05,600 --> 05:03:06,990
I'm not too worried about an AI takeover
there are other International things

17120
05:03:06,990 --> 05:03:07,000
there are other International things
 

17121
05:03:07,000 --> 05:03:09,910
there are other International things
that are worrying but there's just fun

17122
05:03:09,910 --> 05:03:09,920
that are worrying but there's just fun
 

17123
05:03:09,920 --> 05:03:13,230
that are worrying but there's just fun
fundamental human goodness and trying to

17124
05:03:13,230 --> 05:03:13,240
fundamental human goodness and trying to
 

17125
05:03:13,240 --> 05:03:16,590
fundamental human goodness and trying to
amplify that I like we're on a tenuous

17126
05:03:16,590 --> 05:03:16,600
amplify that I like we're on a tenuous
 

17127
05:03:16,600 --> 05:03:19,430
amplify that I like we're on a tenuous
time and I mean if you look at Humanity

17128
05:03:19,430 --> 05:03:19,440
time and I mean if you look at Humanity
 

17129
05:03:19,440 --> 05:03:22,110
time and I mean if you look at Humanity
as as a whole there's been times where

17130
05:03:22,110 --> 05:03:22,120
as as a whole there's been times where
 

17131
05:03:22,120 --> 05:03:23,788
as as a whole there's been times where
things go backwards there's times when

17132
05:03:23,788 --> 05:03:23,798
things go backwards there's times when
 

17133
05:03:23,798 --> 05:03:25,470
things go backwards there's times when
things don't happen at all and we're on

17134
05:03:25,470 --> 05:03:25,480
things don't happen at all and we're on
 

17135
05:03:25,480 --> 05:03:27,590
things don't happen at all and we're on
a what should be very positive

17136
05:03:27,590 --> 05:03:27,600
a what should be very positive
 

17137
05:03:27,600 --> 05:03:29,390
a what should be very positive
trajectory right now yeah there seems to

17138
05:03:29,390 --> 05:03:29,400
trajectory right now yeah there seems to
 

17139
05:03:29,400 --> 05:03:31,788
trajectory right now yeah there seems to
be progress but just like with with with

17140
05:03:31,788 --> 05:03:31,798
be progress but just like with with with
 

17141
05:03:31,798 --> 05:03:34,708
be progress but just like with with with
power uh there's like spikes of human

17142
05:03:34,708 --> 05:03:34,718
power uh there's like spikes of human
 

17143
05:03:34,718 --> 05:03:36,948
power uh there's like spikes of human
suffering and we want to try to minimize

17144
05:03:36,948 --> 05:03:36,958
suffering and we want to try to minimize
 

17145
05:03:36,958 --> 05:03:40,070
suffering and we want to try to minimize
the amount of spikes generally human is

17146
05:03:40,070 --> 05:03:40,080
the amount of spikes generally human is
 

17147
05:03:40,080 --> 05:03:41,788
the amount of spikes generally human is
going to suffer a lot less right I'm

17148
05:03:41,788 --> 05:03:41,798
going to suffer a lot less right I'm
 

17149
05:03:41,798 --> 05:03:44,788
going to suffer a lot less right I'm
very optimistic about that um I do worry

17150
05:03:44,788 --> 05:03:44,798
very optimistic about that um I do worry
 

17151
05:03:44,798 --> 05:03:47,670
very optimistic about that um I do worry
of like techn fascism type stuff arising

17152
05:03:47,670 --> 05:03:47,680
of like techn fascism type stuff arising
 

17153
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:50,470
of like techn fascism type stuff arising
as uh AI becomes more and more prevalent

17154
05:03:50,470 --> 05:03:50,480
as uh AI becomes more and more prevalent
 

17155
05:03:50,480 --> 05:03:52,548
as uh AI becomes more and more prevalent
and powerful and those who control it

17156
05:03:52,548 --> 05:03:52,558
and powerful and those who control it
 

17157
05:03:52,558 --> 05:03:54,628
and powerful and those who control it
can do more and more uh maybe it doesn't

17158
05:03:54,628 --> 05:03:54,638
can do more and more uh maybe it doesn't
 

17159
05:03:54,638 --> 05:03:57,948
can do more and more uh maybe it doesn't
kill us all uh but at some point every

17160
05:03:57,948 --> 05:03:57,958
kill us all uh but at some point every
 

17161
05:03:57,958 --> 05:03:59,670
kill us all uh but at some point every
very powerful human is going to want a

17162
05:03:59,670 --> 05:03:59,680
very powerful human is going to want a
 

17163
05:03:59,680 --> 05:04:01,110
very powerful human is going to want a
brain computer interface so that they

17164
05:04:01,110 --> 05:04:01,120
brain computer interface so that they
 

17165
05:04:01,120 --> 05:04:03,430
brain computer interface so that they
can interact with the a AGI and all of

17166
05:04:03,430 --> 05:04:03,440
can interact with the a AGI and all of
 

17167
05:04:03,440 --> 05:04:04,990
can interact with the a AGI and all of
its advantages in many more way and

17168
05:04:04,990 --> 05:04:05,000
its advantages in many more way and
 

17169
05:04:05,000 --> 05:04:06,708
its advantages in many more way and
merge its mind with you know sort of

17170
05:04:06,708 --> 05:04:06,718
merge its mind with you know sort of
 

17171
05:04:06,718 --> 05:04:08,390
merge its mind with you know sort of
like and its capabilities or that

17172
05:04:08,390 --> 05:04:08,400
like and its capabilities or that
 

17173
05:04:08,400 --> 05:04:10,548
like and its capabilities or that
person's capabilities uh can leverage

17174
05:04:10,548 --> 05:04:10,558
person's capabilities uh can leverage
 

17175
05:04:10,558 --> 05:04:12,150
person's capabilities uh can leverage
those much better than anyone else and

17176
05:04:12,150 --> 05:04:12,160
those much better than anyone else and
 

17177
05:04:12,160 --> 05:04:13,750
those much better than anyone else and
therefore be you know it won't be one

17178
05:04:13,750 --> 05:04:13,760
therefore be you know it won't be one
 

17179
05:04:13,760 --> 05:04:16,270
therefore be you know it won't be one
person rule them all but it will be uh

17180
05:04:16,270 --> 05:04:16,280
person rule them all but it will be uh
 

17181
05:04:16,280 --> 05:04:17,230
person rule them all but it will be uh
you know the thing I worry about is

17182
05:04:17,230 --> 05:04:17,240
you know the thing I worry about is
 

17183
05:04:17,240 --> 05:04:19,350
you know the thing I worry about is
it'll be like few people you know you

17184
05:04:19,350 --> 05:04:19,360
it'll be like few people you know you
 

17185
05:04:19,360 --> 05:04:20,868
it'll be like few people you know you
know hundreds thousands tens of

17186
05:04:20,868 --> 05:04:20,878
know hundreds thousands tens of
 

17187
05:04:20,878 --> 05:04:23,270
know hundreds thousands tens of
thousands maybe millions of people rule

17188
05:04:23,270 --> 05:04:23,280
thousands maybe millions of people rule
 

17189
05:04:23,280 --> 05:04:26,708
thousands maybe millions of people rule
whoever's left right um and the economy

17190
05:04:26,708 --> 05:04:26,718
whoever's left right um and the economy
 

17191
05:04:26,718 --> 05:04:28,470
whoever's left right um and the economy
around it right and I think it'll that's

17192
05:04:28,470 --> 05:04:28,480
around it right and I think it'll that's
 

17193
05:04:28,480 --> 05:04:29,750
around it right and I think it'll that's
like the the thing that's probably more

17194
05:04:29,750 --> 05:04:29,760
like the the thing that's probably more
 

17195
05:04:29,760 --> 05:04:32,708
like the the thing that's probably more
worrisome is like human machine

17196
05:04:32,708 --> 05:04:32,718
worrisome is like human machine
 

17197
05:04:32,718 --> 05:04:35,190
worrisome is like human machine
amalgamations this enables an individual

17198
05:04:35,190 --> 05:04:35,200
amalgamations this enables an individual
 

17199
05:04:35,200 --> 05:04:37,150
amalgamations this enables an individual
human to have more impact on the world

17200
05:04:37,150 --> 05:04:37,160
human to have more impact on the world
 

17201
05:04:37,160 --> 05:04:38,990
human to have more impact on the world
and that impact can be both positive and

17202
05:04:38,990 --> 05:04:39,000
and that impact can be both positive and
 

17203
05:04:39,000 --> 05:04:40,270
and that impact can be both positive and
negative right

17204
05:04:40,270 --> 05:04:40,280
negative right
 

17205
05:04:40,280 --> 05:04:41,708
negative right
uh generally humans have positive

17206
05:04:41,708 --> 05:04:41,718
uh generally humans have positive
 

17207
05:04:41,718 --> 05:04:44,110
uh generally humans have positive
impacts on the world at least Society uh

17208
05:04:44,110 --> 05:04:44,120
impacts on the world at least Society uh
 

17209
05:04:44,120 --> 05:04:45,830
impacts on the world at least Society uh
but it's possible for individual humans

17210
05:04:45,830 --> 05:04:45,840
but it's possible for individual humans
 

17211
05:04:45,840 --> 05:04:49,230
but it's possible for individual humans
to have such negative impacts and AGI at

17212
05:04:49,230 --> 05:04:49,240
to have such negative impacts and AGI at
 

17213
05:04:49,240 --> 05:04:51,110
to have such negative impacts and AGI at
least as I think the labs Define it

17214
05:04:51,110 --> 05:04:51,120
least as I think the labs Define it
 

17215
05:04:51,120 --> 05:04:53,430
least as I think the labs Define it
which is not a runaway sentient thing

17216
05:04:53,430 --> 05:04:53,440
which is not a runaway sentient thing
 

17217
05:04:53,440 --> 05:04:55,110
which is not a runaway sentient thing
but rather just something that can do a

17218
05:04:55,110 --> 05:04:55,120
but rather just something that can do a
 

17219
05:04:55,120 --> 05:04:57,948
but rather just something that can do a
lot of tasks really efficiently um

17220
05:04:57,948 --> 05:04:57,958
lot of tasks really efficiently um
 

17221
05:04:57,958 --> 05:04:59,670
lot of tasks really efficiently um
amplifies the capabilities of someone

17222
05:04:59,670 --> 05:04:59,680
amplifies the capabilities of someone
 

17223
05:04:59,680 --> 05:05:02,670
amplifies the capabilities of someone
causing extreme damage uh but but for

17224
05:05:02,670 --> 05:05:02,680
causing extreme damage uh but but for
 

17225
05:05:02,680 --> 05:05:04,788
causing extreme damage uh but but for
the most part I think it'll be used for

17226
05:05:04,788 --> 05:05:04,798
the most part I think it'll be used for
 

17227
05:05:04,798 --> 05:05:06,270
the most part I think it'll be used for
you know profit-seeking motives which

17228
05:05:06,270 --> 05:05:06,280
you know profit-seeking motives which
 

17229
05:05:06,280 --> 05:05:07,830
you know profit-seeking motives which
will then reduce which will increase the

17230
05:05:07,830 --> 05:05:07,840
will then reduce which will increase the
 

17231
05:05:07,840 --> 05:05:09,070
will then reduce which will increase the
abundance and supply of things and

17232
05:05:09,070 --> 05:05:09,080
abundance and supply of things and
 

17233
05:05:09,080 --> 05:05:10,830
abundance and supply of things and
therefore reduce suffering

17234
05:05:10,830 --> 05:05:10,840
therefore reduce suffering
 

17235
05:05:10,840 --> 05:05:13,190
therefore reduce suffering
right yeah that's the goal scrolling on

17236
05:05:13,190 --> 05:05:13,200
right yeah that's the goal scrolling on
 

17237
05:05:13,200 --> 05:05:18,310
right yeah that's the goal scrolling on
a a timeline just stasis it's holding

17238
